Personally	I

I	I

evidence	I
about	I
the	I
reduction	I
of	I
crime	I
rates	I
due	I
to	I
the	I

because	I
of	I
many	I
reasons	I
.	I
Firstly	I
,	O
capital	I
punishment	I
is	I
a	I
form	I
of	I
revenge	I
which	I
creates	I
violent	I
culture	I
.	I
Crimes	I
kill	I
someone	I
which	I
is	I
illegal	I
;	I
nevertheless	I
,	I
the	I
government	I
use	I

punish	I
them	I
,	I
which	I
is	I
the	I
same	I
way	I
they	I
sinned	I
but	I
in	I
a	I

one	I

As	I
a	I
fact	I
that	I
the	I
criminal	I

repeated	I
second	I
time	I
;	I
also	I
,	I
it	I
is	I
regarded	I
as	I
the	I
""""	I
legalized	I
revenge	I
""""	I
to	I
victims	I
'	I

Hence	I
,	I
death	I
penalty	I
neither	I
controls	I
the	I
violent	I
in	I
society	I
nor	I
creates	I
a	I
violent	I
culture	I
.	I
Secondly	I
,	O
nobody	I
has	I
the	I
right	I
to	I
take	I
another	I
human	I
life	I
.	I
It	I
is	I
undeniable	I
that	I
the	I

the	I

even	I
if	I

If	I
you	I

a	I
criminal	I
,	I
you	I
become	I
a	I
criminal	I

Moreover	I
,	O
if	I
we	I
think	I
that	I
killing	I
is	I
the	I
best	I
way	I

solve	I
the	I
problem	I

it	I
is	I
neither	I
unethical	I
nor	I
immoral	I

In	I
short	I
,	O
crimes	I
seem	I
to	I
increase	I
due	I
to	I
the	I

Finally	I

punishment	I

an	I
easy	I

Criminals	I

someone	I

their	I

for	I

it	I
is	I
so	I
easy	I
for	I
them	I

They	I
do	I
not	I
undergo	I
any	I
pain	I

most	I

continue	I
their	I
social	I
participation	I
in	I
all	I
through	I
life	I

By	I
making	I
teamwork	I
,	O
the	I
children	I

may	I
learn	I
to	I
how	I
to	I
get	I
along	I
with	I
others	I
.	I
As	I
university	I
students	I
,	O
it	I
is	I

a	I
person	I
to	I
success	I
in	I
life	I
than	I
to	I
success	I
only	I
academically	I
.	I
Success	I
in	I
life	I
should	I
be	I
the	I
ultimate	I
goal	I
of	I
a	I
student	I
,	O
which	I
requires	I
more	I
than	I
academic	I
knowledge	I
,	O
but	I
also	I
practical	I
life	I
skills	I
such	I
as	I
cooking	I
,	O
good	I
communication	I
skills	I
and	I
teamwork	I
spirit	I
.	I
Thus	I
,	O
school	I
education	I
should	I
not	I
only	I
focus	I
on	I
the	I
academic	I
development	I
of	I
a	I
student	I
as	I
it	I
is	I
much	I
more	I
crucial	I
to	I
teach	I
them	I
how	I
to	I
be	I
independent	I
and	I
live	I
a	I
good	I
life	I
.	I
Some	I
people	I
may	I
argue	I
that	I
students	I
can	I
learn	I
practical	I
skills	I
after	I
school	I
hours	I
from	I
their	I
parents	I
.	I
However	I
,	O
I	I
believe	I
that	I
it	I
is	I
not	I
a	I
good	I
idea	I
because	I
most	I
young	I
people	I
would	I
rather	I
watch	I
TV	I
or	I
play	I
computer	I
games	I
after	I
school	I
instead	I
of	I
learning	I
life	I
skills	I
from	I
their	I
parents	I
.	I
Moreover	I
,	O
parents	I
are	I
usually	I
too	I
busy	I
with	I
their	I
daily	I
jobs	I
to	I
teach	I
their	I
children	I
the	I
life	I
skills	I
.	I
In	I
conclusion	I
,	O
I	I
strongly	I
believe	I
that	I
non-academic	I
subjects	I
are	I
as	I
essential	I
as	I
academic	I
subjects	I
for	I
a	I
student	I
's	I
development	I
.	I
Therefore	I
,	I
schools	I
should	I
not	I
remove	I
these	I
subjects	I
.	I
Friendship	I
is	I
more	I
important	I
than	I
mistake	I
by	I
a	I
friend	I
,	O
although	I
mistake	I
is	I
terrible	I
There	I
is	I
an	I
argument	I
regrading	I
weather	I
letting	I
a	I
friend	I
make	I
a	I
mistake	I
is	I
better	I
than	I
taking	I
action	I
that	I
risks	I
destroying	I
a	I
friendship	I
.	I
It	I
is	I
widely	I
accepted	I
by	I
many	I
people	I
that	I
a	I
mistake	I
will	I
return	I
sometimes	I
terrible	I
result	I
.	I
However	I
,	O
I	I
believe	I
that	I
friendship	I
is	I
more	I
important	I
than	I
mistake	I
by	I
a	I
friend	I
,	O
although	I
mistake	I
is	I
terrible	I
.	I
In	I
this	I
essay	I
,	O
I	I
will	I
present	I
two	I
reasons	I
supporting	I
my	I
opinion	I
.	I
First	I
of	I
all	I
,	O
a	I
mistake	I
does	I
not	I
last	I
for	I
a	I
long	I
time	I
but	I
a	I
friendship	I
lasts	I
forever	I
.	I
Anybody	I
does	I
not	I
remember	I
mistakes	I
.	I
If	I
someone	I
remembers	I
mistake	I
,	I
he	I
or	I
she	I
has	I
a	I
closed	I
mind	I
.	I
I	I
want	I
to	I
say	I
that	I
mistakes	I
will	I
be	I
forgotten	I
quickly	I
.	I
For	I
example	I
,	O
my	I
friend	I
Lee	I
made	I
a	I
mistake	I
that	I
he	I
broke	I
my	I
precious	I
gift	I
.	I
However	I
,	O
I	I
forgot	I
about	I
it	I
just	I
after	I
two	I
days	I
,	O
and	I
I	I
felt	I
at	I
peace	I
with	I
him	I
.	I
Some	I
people	I
might	I
say	I
I	I
am	I
silly	I
,	I
but	I
I	I
think	I
mistake	I
is	I
more	I
forgettable	I
than	I
friendship	I
.	I
Second	I
,	I
Everybody	I
makes	I
mistake	I
.	I
However	I
,	O
if	I
you	I
end	I
a	I
friendship	I
whenever	I
your	I
friend	I
makes	I
a	I
mistake	I
,	O
there	I
will	I
be	I
no	I
friends	I
around	I
you	I
.	I
I	I
agree	I
if	I
a	I
friend	I
makes	I
very	I
a	I
big	I
mistake	I
,	I
we	I
will	I
need	I
to	I
end	I
a	I
friendship	I
.	I
However	I
,	O
when	I
the	I
mistake	I
friend	I
made	I
was	I
not	I
a	I
big	I
problem	I
,	O
we	I
need	I
to	I
understand	I
friend	I
and	I
forgive	I
it	I
because	I
a	I
friend	I
is	I
a	I
gift	I
of	I
our	I
life	I
.	I
According	I
to	I
a	I
research	I
,	I
85	I
%	I
of	I
people	I
answered	I
that	I
a	I
best	I
gift	I
is	I
a	I
friend	I
.	I
I	I
think	I
that	I
a	I
mistake	I
can	I
not	I
brake	I
friendship	I
if	I
it	I
is	I
not	I
a	I
big	I
because	I
friendship	I
is	I
forever	I
and	I
gift	I
our	I
life	I
.	I
	O
Financial	I
support	I
for	I
sports	I
and	I
social	I
activities	I
There	I
are	I
a	I
lot	I
of	I
debates	I
about	I
the	I
importance	I
of	I
sports	I
and	I
social	I
activities	I
in	I
contrast	I
with	I
the	I
main	I
classes	I
.	I
It	I
is	I
very	I
subjective	I
decision	I
for	I
students	I
to	I
have	I
or	I
not	I
have	I
these	I
facilities	I
.	I
Although	O
multitudes	I
of	I
people	I
think	I
that	I
sports	I
and	I
social	I
activities	I
are	I
not	I
as	I
necessary	I
as	I
academic	I
subjects	I
in	I
colleges	I
,	I
I	I
think	I
that	I
these	I
activities	I
have	I
the	I
same	I
efficient	I
role	I
in	I
students	I
'	I
lives	I
.	I
In	I
the	I
following	I
,	I
I	I
will	I
state	I
my	I
reason	I
for	I
this	I
choice	I
.	I
First	I
,	O
besides	I
the	I
good	I
body	I
shape	I
,	O
sports	I
have	I
very	I
vital	I
effects	I
on	I
human	I
's	I
healthfulness	I
.	I
In	I
my	I
viewpoint	I
,	O
our	I
body	I
and	I
moral	I
health	I
depend	I
to	I
physical	I
activities	I
directly	I
.	I
As	I
a	I
case	I
in	I
point	I
,	I
last	I
month	I
I	I
had	I
very	I
difficult	I
exam	I
that	I
I	I
forced	I
to	I
study	I
for	I
one	I
week	I
back	I
to	I
back	I
.	I
After	I
that	I
exam	I
,	I
I	I
felt	I
depressed	I
and	I
exhausted	I
.	I
Therefore	I
,	O
I	I
decided	I
to	I
go	I
to	I
gym	I
to	I
recuperate	I
and	I
it	I
responded	I
very	I
well	I
!	O
As	I
a	I
result	I
,	O
sports	I
are	I
necessary	I
for	I
students	I
to	I
acquire	I
their	I
energy	I
and	I
health	I
.	I
Second	I
,	O
besides	I
the	I
academic	I
knowledge	I
,	O
the	I
awareness	I
of	I
social	I
behavior	I
is	I
an	I
important	I
factor	I
for	I
human	I
's	I
life	I
.	I
As	I
a	I
practical	I
epitome	I
,	O
students	I
should	I
be	I
prepared	I
to	I
present	I
in	I
society	I
after	I
their	I
graduation	I
.	I
Thus	I
social	I
activities	I
can	I
help	I
them	I
to	I
be	I
familiar	I
with	I
other	I
's	I
mind	I
and	I
different	I
environment	I
.	I
In	I
my	I
opinion	I
,	O
social	I
groups	I
and	I
classes	I
are	I
significant	I
factors	I
to	I
prepare	I
students	I
to	I
contribute	I
in	I
discussion	I
and	I
encounter	I
real	I
social	I
environment	I
.	I
So	I
,	O
social	I
activities	I
have	I
same	I
rights	I
to	I
receive	I
monetary	I
support	I
.	I
Moreover	I
,	O
they	I
bring	I
about	I
students	I
to	I
be	I
happier	I
and	I
to	I
have	I
more	I
fun	I
and	I
entertainments	I
.	I
If	I
we	I
follow	I
just	I
one	I
wing	I
of	I
my	I
life	I
i.e.	I
,	O
studying	I
as	I
a	I
student	I
,	O
after	I
some	I
whiles	I
it	I
would	I
be	I
boring	I
and	I
we	I
would	I
n't	I
have	I
any	I
motivation	I
.	I
Such	I
activities	I
can	I
help	I
us	I
to	I
pick	I
up	I
with	I
other	I
students	I
and	I
have	I
more	I
friends	I
.	I
In	I
my	I
perspective	I
,	O
more	I
friends	I
and	I
new	I
experience	I
inspire	I
the	I
feeling	I
of	I
happiness	I
and	I
excitement	I
in	I
me	I
.	I
All	I
in	I
all	I
,	O
I	I
am	I
in	I
the	I
conviction	I
that	I
sports	I
and	I
social	I
activities	I
should	I
obtain	I
analogous	I
concern	I
and	I
money	I
in	I
the	I
view	I
of	I
above-mentioned	I
reasons	I
.	I
They	I
bring	I
a	I
lot	I
of	I
advantages	I
and	I
benefits	I
for	I
students	I
and	I
also	I
affect	I
their	I
future	I
in	I
a	I
positive	I
way	I
.	I
School	I
memories	I
Everyone	I
has	I
happy	I
moments	I
during	I
their	I
life	I
.	I
These	I
happy	I
moments	I
are	I
both	I
in	I
their	I
childhood	I
and	I
their	I
adulthood	I
.	I
In	I
my	I
opinion	I
,	I
childhood	I
is	I
the	I
happiest	I
time	I
of	I
a	I
person	I
's	I
life	I
.	I
First	I
,	O
in	I
childhood	I
most	I
people	I
are	I
happier	I
than	I
in	I
adulthood	I
.	I
They	I
do	I
not	I
have	I
to	I
worry	I
about	I
bills	I
,	I
jobs	I
,	I
how	I
would	I
their	I
life	I
be	I
in	I
the	I
future	I
.	I
They	I
just	I
worry	I
about	I
two	I
things	I
:	I
to	I
have	I
fun	I
,	I
learn	I
and	I
be	I
happy	I
.	I
A	I
child	I
's	I
daily	I
life	I
is	I
school	I
,	I
playing	I
and	I
sleeping	I
.	I
For	I
example	I
,	O
when	I
I	I
was	I
young	I
I	I
just	I
came	I
home	I
from	I
school	I
and	I
then	I
I	I
would	I
took	I
my	I
bike	I
or	I
soccer	I
ball	I
and	I
go	I
out	I
and	I
play	I
with	I
my	I
friends	I
in	I
my	I
neighborhood	I
.	I
Moreover	I
,	O
I	I
did	I
not	I
have	I
to	I
worry	I
about	I
costs	I
and	I
other	I
things	I
,	O
I	I
just	I
had	I
fun	I
and	I
learned	I
.	I
Also	I
,	O
people	I
are	I
most	I
creative	I
when	I
they	I
were	I
children	I
,	O
children	I
imagine	I
new	I
things	I
and	I
games	I
just	I
to	I
have	I
fun	I
and	I
be	I
happy	I
.	I
Second	I
,	O
childhood	I
is	I
the	I
period	I
where	I
people	I
go	I
to	I
school	I
and	I
learn	I
.	I
Therefore	I
,	O
school	I
memories	I
are	I
one	I
of	I
the	I
best	I
memories	I
in	I
a	I
person	I
's	I
life	I
.	I
There	I
you	I
learn	I
,	O
to	I
find	I
your	I
first	I
love	I
,	O
to	I
make	I
new	I
long-lasting	I
friendships	I
and	I
of-course	I
you	I
will	I
have	I
a	I
lot	I
of	I
fun	I
.	I
For	I
example	I
,	O
my	I
father	I
's	I
best	I
moments	I
in	I
his	I
life	I
are	I
in	I
his	I
school	I
years	I
.	I
Moreover	I
,	O
he	I
is	I
still	I
in-touch	I
with	I
some	I
of	I
his	I
classmates	I
and	I
sometimes	I
they	I
get	I
together	I
and	I
share	I
their	I
childhood	I
memories	I
.	I
In	I
other	I
words	I
,	O
childhood	I
is	I
,	O
indeed	I
,	O
the	I
most	I
happiest	I
moments	I
in	I
a	I
person	I
's	I
life	I
.	I
There	I
is	I
only	I
one	I
life	I
and	I
one	I
childhood	I
and	I
people	I
should	I
live	I
their	I
childhood	I
thoroughly	I
.	I
Do	O
you	I
agree	I
or	I
disagree	I
with	I
the	I
statement	I
that	I
a	I
zoo	I
has	I
no	I
useful	I
purpose	I
Some	I
people	I
may	I
believe	I
that	I
a	I
zoo	I
is	I
futile	I
in	I
the	I
era	I
of	I
globalization	I
,	I
which	I
people	I
can	I
develop	I
their	I
knowledge	I
fast	I
and	I
easily	I
.	I
However	I
,	I
I	I
do	I
not	I
agree	I
with	I
them	I
.	I
I	I
believe	I
that	I
the	I
zoo	I
is	I
invaluable	I
for	I
human	I
beings	I
.	I
It	I
is	I
very	I
crucial	I
for	I
learning	I
.	I
It	I
helps	I
animals	I
out	I
of	I
extinction	I
.	I
Also	I
,	I
it	I
is	I
a	I
interesting	I
travel	I
location	I
.	I
First	I
of	I
all	I
,	I
the	I
zoo	I
gives	I
humans	I
new	I
knowledge	I
.	I
When	I
you	I
were	I
so	I
young	I
that	I
you	I
did	I
not	I
know	I
many	I
kinds	I
of	I
animals	I
,	I
what	I
should	I
you	I
do	I
if	I
there	I
were	I
no	I
zoo	I
?	O
Inevitably	I
,	O
the	I
zoo	I
is	I
the	I
important	I
place	I
for	I
innate	I
learning	I
.	I
The	I
zoo	I
also	I
let	I
students	I
have	I
a	I
chance	I
to	I
learning	I
biology	I
practically	I
.	I
They	I
are	I
able	I
to	I
observe	I
animals	I
'	I
behaviors	I
and	I
features	I
.	I
Moreover	I
,	O
practical	I
learning	I
help	I
students	I
relax	I
from	I
a	I
boring	I
lecture	I
class	I
.	I
Besides	I
,	O
researchers	I
need	I
the	I
zoo	I
to	I
pick	I
up	I
some	I
examples	I
of	I
animals	I
for	I
their	I
researches	I
because	I
it	I
has	I
diverse	I
species	I
of	I
animals	I
.	I
Secondly	I
,	O
the	I
zoo	I
preserves	I
a	I
large	I
number	I
of	I
rare	I
animals	I
and	I
provides	I
them	I
safe	I
habitats	I
.	I
In	I
the	I
zoo	I
,	I
there	I
is	I
not	I
so	I
harmful	I
as	I
a	I
forest	I
.	I
They	I
,	O
fed	I
by	I
zookeepers	I
,	O
do	I
not	I
need	I
to	I
find	I
food	I
themselves	I
.	I
Furthermore	I
,	I
we	I
can	I
do	I
artificial	I
insemenation	I
to	I
maintain	I
nearly	I
extinct	I
wildlife	I
.	I
Last	I
but	I
not	I
least	I
,	O
because	I
of	I
all	I
weird	I
,	O
acute	I
,	O
and	I
beautiful	I
animals	I
in	I
the	I
zoo	I
,	O
it	I
can	I
be	I
a	I
great	I
tourist	I
attraction	I
.	I
There	I
are	I
a	I
lot	I
of	I
tourists	I
who	I
seek	I
to	I
see	I
those	I
animals	I
closely	I
.	I
If	I
the	I
zoo	I
has	I
a	I
large	I
number	I
of	I
both	I
national	I
and	I
foreign	I
tourists	I
,	I
it	I
will	I
receive	I
a	I
great	I
deal	I
of	I
money	I
.	I
That	I
also	I
make	I
money	I
flow	I
,	I
and	I
then	I
economics	I
become	I
better	I
.	I
It	I
benefits	I
to	I
a	I
certain	I
country	I
.	I
In	I
conclusion	I
,	O
the	I
zoo	I
not	I
only	I
saves	I
animals	I
in	I
danger	I
of	I
extinction	I
,	O
but	I
also	I
helps	I
people	I
around	I
the	I
world	I
have	I
better	I
lives	I
.	I
I	I
firmly	I
believe	I
that	I
the	I
zoo	I
is	I
so	I
useful	I
for	I
the	I
earth	I
.	I
Technology	I
makes	I
people	I
's	I
lives	I
simpler	I
rather	I
than	I
complicated	I
Believe	I
it	I
or	I
not	I
,	O
nowadays	I
people	I
are	I
always	I
confronted	I
with	I
a	I
problem	I
that	I
whether	I
technology	I
makes	I
their	I
life	I
simpler	I
or	I
not	I
,	O
thus	I
making	I
them	I
confused	I
.	I
Many	I
people	I
advocate	I
that	I
technology	I
makes	I
their	I
life	I
easier	I
.	I

when	I
it	I

to	I
the	I
field	I

there	I
is	I
no	I
doubt	I
that	I
the	I
technology	I
in	I

has	I
made	I
people	I

simpler	I

With	I
a	I

you	I

a	I

you	I
there	I

only	I
a	I

which	I
is	I
hard	I
to	I
imagine	I
in	I
the	I
ancient	I
times	I

Second	I
,	I
technology	I
also	I
makes	I
teaching	I
simpler	I

In	I
the	I
past	I
,	O
teachers	I
have	I
to	I
write	I
what	I
they	I
want	I
to	I
convey	I
to	I
students	I
on	I
the	I

in	I
a	I
great	I
waste	I
of	I
time	I

the	I
fatigue	I
of	I
teachers	I

With	I
the	I
advent	I
of	I
iPads	I
in	I

,	O
paper	I
books	I
become	I
unnecessary	I
,	O
so	I
does	I
the	I

it	I
is	I
because	I
all	I
the	I
knowledge	I

are	I
stored	I
in	I
the	I
iPads	I

with	I
a	I

they	I

some	I
extent	I

may	I

For	I

the	I
cell	I

which	I
used	I

be	I
simply	I
a	I

your	I

a	I

playing	I
a	I
role	I
more	I
than	I
just	I
a	I

For	I

Consequently	I

Based	I
on	I
the	I
factors	I
I	I

above	I

a	I
conclusion	I
can	I
be	I
drawn	I
that	I
although	I

During	I

for	I
20	I
Kilometers	I
in	I
a	I
marathon	I
running	I
tournament	I
2014	I
,	I
I	I
saw	I
some	I
people	I
stopped	I
running	I
while	I
the	I
others	I
fought	I
until	I
their	I
last	I
minute	I
.	I
At	I
some	I
moment	I
,	O
my	I
body	I
was	I
telling	I
me	I
to	I
stop	I
but	I
the	I
choice	I
that	I
I	I
made	I
was	I
on	I
the	I
contrary	I
.	I
I	I
did	I
not	I
stop	I
and	I
won	I
a	I
medal	I
goals	I
in	I
my	I
life	I
at	I
the	I
age	I
of	I
nearly	I
thirty	I
.	I
From	I
this	I
experience	I
,	O
I	I
believe	I
that	I
a	I
person	I
should	I
keep	I
trying	I
for	I
his	I
goals	I
.	I
Firstly	I
,	I
committing	I
to	I
our	I
goal	I
helps	I
creating	I
personal	I
worth	I
.	I
For	I
example	I
,	O
I	I
realized	I
the	I
true	I
potential	I
of	I
my	I
body	I
and	I
mind	I
as	I
I	I
decided	I
to	I
train	I
myself	I
hard	I
.	I
Even	I
if	I
I	I
were	I
not	I
to	I
win	I
this	I
medal	I
,	I
I	I
acknowledged	I
the	I
great	I
amount	I
of	I
my	I
endeavor	I
as	I
I	I
could	I
keep	I
my	I
tired	I
legs	I
running	I
.	I
Secondly	I
,	O
one	I
who	I
learns	I
the	I
great	I
difficulty	I
will	I
become	I
stronger	I
.	I
I	I
remembered	I
how	I
I	I
was	I
suffered	I
in	I
the	I
first	I
round	I
when	I
I	I
was	I
last	I
person	I
who	I
touched	I
the	I
line	I
.	I
However	I
,	O
I	I
did	I
not	I
give	I
up	I
,	O
and	I
believed	I
that	I
I	I
would	I
be	I
better	I
in	I
the	I
next	I
round	I
because	I
I	I
knew	I
how	I
to	I
improve	I
myself	I
.	I
I	I
had	I
been	I
a	I
loser	I
for	I
a	I
thousand	I
time	I
before	I
the	I
first	I
winning	I
,	I
and	I
suffering	I
from	I
losing	I
in	I
each	I
competition	I
makes	I
me	I
stronger	I
.	I
Thirdly	I
,	O
at	I
some	I
point	I
,	O
we	I
,	O
as	I
an	I
average	I
people	I
,	O
might	I
feel	I
that	I
the	I
responsibility	I
to	I
our	I
goal	I
is	I
too	I
heavy	I
to	I
carry	I
on	I
.	I
I	I
believe	I
that	I
the	I
responsibility	I
is	I
worthy	I
of	I
carrying	I
.	I
When	I
the	I
distance	I
is	I
longer	I
and	I
harder	I
to	I
achieve	I
,	I
a	I
runner	I
who	I
can	I
go	I
beyond	I
his	I
limit	I
will	I
proud	I
of	I
himself	I
.	I
He	I
can	I
feel	I
the	I
sweetness	I
of	I
triumph	I
because	I
he	I
did	I
not	I
stop	I
pursing	I
his	I
goal	I
.	I
For	I
these	I
reasons	I
,	O
I	I
agree	I
that	I
one	I
should	I
not	I
give	I
up	I
,	O
as	I
the	I
true	I
reward	I
is	I
to	I
have	I
the	I
dignity	I
.	I
Anyone	I
who	I
wants	I
to	I
achieve	I
the	I
goal	I
should	I
acknowledge	I
that	I
his	I
effort	I
and	I
experience	I
from	I
suffering	I
helps	I
him	I
understand	I
his	I
true	I
potential	I
and	I
increase	I
his	I
strength	I
,	I
and	I
ultimately	I
,	I
it	I
will	I
prompt	I
him	I
to	I
be	I
ready	I
for	I
overcoming	I
the	I
greater	I
challenge	I
in	I
his	I
life	I

Advertisements	I

goods	I
Everyday	I

companies	I
offer	I
a	I
huge	I
number	I
of	I
different	I
products	I
to	I
consumers	I
.	I
The	I
most	I
effective	I
way	I
to	I
convince	I
consumers	I
to	I
purchase	I
a	I
product	I
is	I
through	I
advertising	I

However	I
,	I
it	I
is	I
not	I
sufficient	I
in	I
itself	I
.	I
The	I
product	I
also	I
should	I
satisfy	I
the	I
needs	I
of	I
the	I
consumers	I
.	I
In	I
my	I
opinion	I
,	O
advertising	I
is	I
the	I
major	I
reason	I
for	I
high	I
sales	I
of	I
a	I
product	I
for	I
several	I
reasons	I
.	I
We	I
are	I
mainly	I
introduced	I
to	I
products	I
through	I
advertisements	I

Therefore	I
,	O
advertisers	I
push	I
the	I
limits	I
of	I
creativity	I
to	I
dispose	I
the	I
consumers	I
to	I
purchase	I
the	I
product	I

When	I
the	I
consumers	I
are	I
impressed	I
by	I
the	I
way	I
a	I
product	I
is	I
advertised	I
,	I
they	I
can	I
be	I
convinced	I
to	I
consider	I
that	I
the	I
product	I
is	I
a	I
need	I
in	I
some	I
cases	I
.	I
Recently	I
,	O
there	I
is	I
a	I
very	I
creative	I
advertisements	I
of	I
a	I
soft	I
drink	I
product	I
on	I
TV	I
.	I
The	I
story	I
delivers	I
a	I
desired	I
call	I
to	I
drink	I
that	I
soft	I
drink	I
that	I
people	I
tend	I
to	I
drink	I
when	I
the	I
weather	I
is	I
too	I
hot	I
.	I
As	I
a	I
result	I
of	I
this	I
,	O
the	I
number	I
of	I
that	I
product	I
being	I
sold	I
will	I
increases	I
.	I
Also	I
,	O
the	I
more	I
an	I
advertisement	I
of	I
a	I
product	I
takes	I
place	I
in	I
mass	I
media	I
,	O
the	I
more	I
popular	I
the	I
product	I
becomes	I
.	I
Advertisement	I
is	I
the	I
most	I
effective	I
way	I
to	I
create	I
a	I
well-known	I
product	I
.	I
Consumers	I
tend	I
to	I
purchase	I
the	I
most	I
known	I
product	I
when	I
it	I
comes	I
to	I
picking	I
one	I
out	I
of	I
two	I
different	I
brands	I
of	I
the	I
same	I
product	I
.	I
When	I
a	I
product	I
is	I
commonly	I
used	I
,	O
it	I
becomes	I
trustworthy	I
for	I
the	I
society	I
,	O
no	I
matter	I
what	I
quality	I
it	I
is	I
.	I
However	I
,	I
it	I
also	I
has	I
to	I
be	I
affordable	I
for	I
the	I
consumer	I
.	I
Considering	I
this	I
fact	I
,	O
advertisements	I
have	I
undeniable	I
affects	I
on	I
the	I
society	I
about	I
the	I
product	I
being	I
advertised	I
.	I
They	I
make	I
the	I
product	I
preferable	I
.	I
In	I
conclusion	I
,	O
as	I
I	I
believe	I
that	I
consumers	I
should	I
consider	I
major	I
needs	I
when	I
they	I
purchase	I
goods	I
,	O
high	I
sales	I
are	I
obviously	I
a	I
reflection	I
of	I
the	I
powerful	I
advertisements	I

Should	I
the	I
Government	I
Provide	I
Free	I
College	I

Some	I
people	I

that	I
the	I

for	I
any	I
citizen	I
who	I
wants	I
to	I
go	I
to	I
a	I

However	I
,	O
I	I
believe	I
that	I
individuals	I
should	I
pay	I
their	I
college	I
tuition	I
because	I
it	I
would	I
cost	I
too	I
much	I
,	O
the	I
college	I

is	I
a	I

and	I
there	I
are	I
many	I
ways	I
to	I
fund	I
a	I
college	I
education	I
.	I
First	I
,	O
making	I
college	I
education	I
free	I
would	I
cost	I
too	I
much	I

It	I
would	I
divert	I
public	I
funds	I
from	I
other	I
needs	I
such	I
as	I
law	I
enforcement	I
,	I
infrastructure	I
and	I
so	I
forth	I

There	I
are	I
many	I
other	I

which	I
should	I
come	I
first	I

such	I
as	I
providing	I
health	I

to	I
all	I
American	I
,	I
or	I
improving	I
public	I
schools	I

In	I
addition	I
,	O
it	I
would	I
cause	I
to	I
raise	I
our	I
taxes	I
again	I
and	I
again	I
to	I
fund	I
college	I
education	I

Consequently	I

it	I
would	I
affect	I
all	I

whether	I

not	I
they	I
benefit	I
from	I
the	I
use	I
of	I
the	I

Second	I
,	I
it	I
is	I
a	I

In	I

Getting	I
opinions	I
from	I

sources	I
could	I
augment	I

's	I
performance	I
.	I
Thereby	I
,	O
evaluating	I
from	I
students	I
is	I
one	I
of	I
the	I
ways	I
to	I
improve	I
quality	I
of	I
educational	I
system	I

Not	I
only	I
teachers	I
could	I
amplify	I
their	I
performance	I
but	I
the	I
whole	I
education	I
system	I
are	I
also	I
improve	I
performance	I
from	I
evaluation	I
made	I
by	I
students	I
.	I
Therefore	I
,	O
I	I
agree	I
with	I
this	I
notion	I
that	I
students	I
should	I
be	I
asked	I
to	I
evaluate	I
their	I
teachers	I
.	I
To	I
begin	I
with	I
,	O
Evaluating	I
teachers	I
made	I
by	I
students	I
could	I
improve	I
teachers	I
'	I
performance	I
.	I
For	I
example	I
,	O
evaluation	I
made	I
by	I
students	I
is	I
similar	I
to	I
feedback	I
from	I
customer	I
that	I
business	I
owners	I
need	I
to	I
know	I
in	I
order	I
to	I
improve	I
their	I
product	I
.	I
Students	I
might	I
complain	I
about	I
their	I
teachers	I
spoke	I
too	I
fast	I
that	I
students	I
could	I
not	I
catch	I
up	I
on	I
information	I
.	I
Consequently	I
,	O
teachers	I
could	I
improve	I
themselves	I
by	I
speaking	I
slower	I
to	I
make	I
sure	I
that	I
students	I
could	I
get	I
all	I
information	I
that	I
they	I
want	I
to	I
give	I
.	I
Therefore	I
,	O
evaluating	I
from	I
students	I
could	I
improve	I
teachers	I
'	I
performance	I
.	I
Additionally	I
,	O
this	I
evaluation	I
from	I
students	I
could	I
improve	I
schools	I
'	I
quality	I
.	I
Teachers	I
could	I
augment	I
their	I
quality	I
.	I
Consequently	I
,	O
When	I
school	I
gather	I
teachers	I
that	I
have	I
great	I
performance	I
,	O
school	I
are	I
gaining	I
higher	I
quality	I
.	I
For	I
instance	I
,	O
in	I
many	I
cooperation	I
such	I
as	I
Microsoft	I
that	I
could	I
produce	I
many	I
great	I
products	I
because	I
they	I
have	I
employees	I
whose	I
performance	I
are	I
very	I
high	I
.	I
Schools	I
could	I
produce	I
intellectual	I
students	I
because	I
school	I
have	I
teachers	I
who	I
are	I
always	I
improve	I
their	I
quality	I
from	I
evaluation	I
made	I
by	I
students	I
.	I
Finally	I
,	O
people	I
who	I
get	I
the	I
most	I
advantage	I
from	I
evaluation	I
is	I
students	I
.	I
Students	I
could	I
study	I
in	I
class	I
that	I
have	I
teachers	I
who	I
have	I
experienced	I
and	I
greater	I
performance	I
.	I
Because	I
teachers	I
are	I
always	I
adapt	I
the	I
way	I
they	I
teach	I
in	I
order	I
to	I
make	I
students	I
easy	I
to	I
understand	I
their	I
subjects	I
,	I
students	I
could	I
comprehend	I
their	I
subject	I
easily	I
.	I
As	I
a	I
result	I
,	O
students	I
,	O
who	I
study	I
from	I
great	I
schools	I
which	I
have	I
great	I
performance	I
teacher	I
,	O
graduate	I
with	I
great	I
knowledge	I
to	I
survive	I
in	I
next	I
steps	I
of	I
life	I
.	I
In	I
conclusion	I
,	O
I	I
agree	I
with	I
this	I
statement	I
that	I
school	I
should	I
ask	I
students	I
to	I
evaluate	I
their	I
teachers	I
because	I
teachers	I
could	I
improve	I
their	I
performance	I
.	I
Moreover	I
,	O
schools	I
are	I
also	I
improve	I
their	I
quality	I
because	I
they	I
have	I
high	I
performance	I
teachers	I
.	I
Furthermore	I
,	I
students	I
are	I
easy	I
to	I
understand	I
their	I
subjects	I
.	I
Thus	I
,	O
I	I
believe	I
that	I
there	I
are	I
benefits	I
to	I
ask	I
students	I
to	I
evaluate	I
their	I
teachers	I

Traditional	I
skills	I
and	I
ways	I
are	I
always	I
valuable	I
and	I
will	I
last	I
forever	I
These	I
days	I
,	I
most	I
of	I
countries	I
on	I
the	I
world	I
invest	I
for	I
technology	I
.	I
It	I
is	I
evident	I
that	I
technology	I
promotes	I
economy	I
.	I
Many	I
people	I
think	I
that	I
conventional	I
things	I
will	I
not	I
exist	I
and	I
should	I
be	I
eliminated	I
.	I
I	I
totally	I
disagree	I
this	I
opinion	I
.	I
First	I
of	I
all	I
,	O
traditional	I
skills	I
and	I
ways	I
belong	I
to	I
value	I
of	I
culture	I
.	I
They	I
make	I
differences	I
between	I
countries	I
.	I
Every	I
country	I
has	I
unique	I
tradtions	I
which	I
show	I
their	I
creation	I
,	I
intelligence	I
.	I
Consequently	I
,	O
people	I
feel	I
pround	I
of	I
their	I
country	I
,	O
so	I
they	I
keep	I
reserving	I
conventions	I
.	I
For	I
example	I
,	O
ways	I
to	I
build	I
a	I
house	I
in	I
every	I
country	I
are	I
different	I
and	I
they	I
distinguish	I
between	I
countries	I
.	I
In	I
addition	I
,	O
in	I
some	I
cases	I
that	I
traditional	I
way	I
can	I
not	I
replace	I
by	I
a	I
new	I
technology	I
.	I
Lot	I
of	I
people	I
like	I
to	I
use	I
traditional	I
things	I
because	I
if	I
their	I
quality	I
and	I
durability	I
.	I
In	I
paticular	I
,	I
vases	I
are	I
made	I
by	I
hand	I
would	I
be	I
used	I
more	I
.	I
Futhermore	I
,	O
there	I
are	I
plenty	I
of	I
works	I
that	I
using	I
traditional	I
way	I
is	I
unique	I
method	I
.	I
For	I
instance	I
,	O
making	I
cone	I
hats	I
from	I
leaves	I
have	I
to	I
use	I
hand	I
.	I
Not	I
only	I
because	I
there	I
is	I
no	I
machine	I
for	I
the	I
work	I
,	I
but	I
also	I
it	I
looks	I
more	I
beautiful	I
when	I
it	I
is	I
made	I
by	I
hand	I
,	I
so	I
resulting	I
in	I
greater	I
value	I
economy	I
.	I
The	I
last	I
thing	I
is	I
about	I
education	I
.	I
Traditional	I
skills	I
and	I
ways	I
of	I
life	I
will	I
help	I
youngsters	I
study	I
and	I
know	I
more	I
history	I
.	I
Methods	I
which	I
their	I
ancestors	I
used	I
in	I
the	I
past	I
will	I
be	I
displayed	I
again	I
for	I
new	I
generations	I
.	I
After	I
that	I
,	O
they	I
might	I
create	I
somethings	I
that	I
are	I
useful	I
for	I
life	I
.	I
In	I
conclusion	I
,	O
technology	I
has	I
brought	I
many	I
benefits	I
,	O

E-mail	I

Versus	I
Telephone	I

Technology	I
has	I
been	I
developing	I
so	I
quickly	I
and	I
becoming	I
more	I
perfect	I
every	I

Communication	I
nowadays	I

on	I

pretty	I
much	I

,	I
e-mail	I
,	I
telephone	I
or	I
just	I
traditional	I
way	I
:	I
face-to-face	I
.	I
However	I
,	O
I	I
prefer	I
e-mail	I
due	I
to	I
3	I
reasons	I
:	I
convenience	I
,	O
honest	I
expression	I
and	I
fluency	I
in	I
communicating	I
.	I
Everyone	I
agrees	I
that	I
e-mail	I
has	I
been	I
a	I
great	I
way	I
of	I
communication	I
.	I
You	I
can	I
talk	I
to	I
others	I
from	I
thousands	I
mile	I
.	I
For	I
instance	I
,	O
if	I
you	I
are	I
in	I
Vietnam	I
and	I
another	I
person	I
is	I
in	I
the	I
US	I
-	I
half	I
of	I
the	I
Earth	I
,	O
no	I
matter	I
how	I
far	I
it	I
is	I
,	O
you	I
can	I
keep	I
contact	I
.	I
We	I
will	I
never	I
have	I
to	I
worry	I
if	I
our	I
mails	I
will	I
be	I
sent	I
to	I
the	I
right	I
address	I
.	I
If	I
the	I
address	I
is	I
wrong	I
,	I
then	I
you	I
will	I
know	I
right	I
away	I
.	I
Moreover	I
,	O
e-mail	I
does	I
n't	I
take	I
too	I
much	I
time	I
:	I
just	I
a	I
click	I
.	I
In	I
addition	I
,	I
writing	I
e-mail	I
helps	I
people	I
express	I
honestly	I
.	I
Some	I
people	I
think	I
that	I
the	I
face-to-face	I
conversations	I
make	I
them	I
feel	I
stupid	I
.	I
Sometimes	I
,	O
their	I
ideas	I
are	I
not	I
expressed	I
as	I
exactly	I
as	I
they	I
expect	I
.	I
For	I
instance	I
,	O
I	I
want	I
to	I
talk	I
to	I
my	I
friend	I
about	I
a	I
ticklish	I
problem	I
like	I
her	I
behavior	I
,	O
it	I
's	I
hard	I
for	I
me	I
to	I
face	I
her	I
and	I
explain	I
what	I
she	I
should	I
do	I
.	I
Therefore	I
,	O
e-mail	I
will	I
be	I
a	I
good	I
tool	I
to	I
help	I
me	I
speak	I
out	I
.	I
She	I
will	I
just	I
read	I
my	I
e-mail	I
instead	I
of	I
listening	I
to	I
my	I
voice	I
which	I
can	I
make	I
her	I
annoyed	I
.	I
I	I
do	I
n't	I
have	I
to	I
worry	I
about	I
any	I
other	I
thing	I
can	I
make	I
my	I
opinion	I
become	I
unpersuasive	I
.	I
Last	I
but	I
not	I
least	I
,	O
every	I
communication	I
needs	I
fluency	I
so	I
people	I
can	I
understand	I
each	I
other	I
exactly	I
and	I
remember	I
it	I
for	I
a	I
long	I
time	I
.	I
Voice	I
email	I
or	I
face-to-face	I
conversations	I
sometimes	I
make	I
reserve	I
people	I
feel	I
not	I
very	I
confident	I
.	I
For	I
example	I
,	O
when	I
I	I
face	I
my	I
parents	I
,	O
I	I
ca	I
n't	I
speak	I
out	I
every	I
idea	I
and	I
express	I
consecutively	I
.	I
They	I
may	I
stop	I
me	I
,	O
speak	I
something	I
against	I
it	I
and	I
that	I
makes	I
me	I
forget	I
what	I
I	I
want	I
to	I
say	I
.	I
Anyone	I
can	I
meet	I
this	I
problem	I
once	I
in	I
any	I
conversation	I
.	I
E-mail	I
helps	I
me	I
arrange	I
my	I
idea	I
perfectly	I
and	I
make	I
it	I
persuasive	I
.	I
On	I
the	I
whole	I
,	O
to	I
compare	I
to	I
all	I
ways	I
of	I
communication	I
,	O
I	I
really	I
think	I
that	I
e-mail	I
is	I
the	I
greatest	I
way	I
for	I
major	I
people	I
to	I
use	I
.	I
Its	I
convenience	I
saves	I
our	I
time	I

Additionally	I
,	O
honesty	I
is	I
necessary	I
for	I
every	I
conversation	I

fluency	I

n't	I
be	I
missing	I
for	I
a	I
persuasive	I

Early	I
retirement	I
for	I
55+	I
employees	I
to	I
help	I
younger	I
people	I
Nowadays	I
the	I
discussion	I
about	I
whether	I
the	I
businesses	I
are	I
supposed	I
to	I
prescribe	I
the	I
retirement	I
age	I
at	I
fifty-five	I
to	I
offer	I
more	I
job	I
vacancies	I
for	I
younger	I
generation	I
has	I
become	I
a	I
controversy	I
.	I
Some	I
believe	I
that	I
is	I
a	I
perfect	I
attempt	I
to	I
support	I
the	I
young	I
,	I
others	I
claim	I
that	I
this	I
is	I
not	I
the	I
case	I
.	I
Admittedly	I
,	O
encouraging	I
the	I
workers	I
to	I
retire	I
at	I
age	I
of	I
fifty-five	I
to	I
release	I
the	I
positions	I
for	I
younger	I
job	I
seekers	I
has	I
some	I
merits	I
.	I
Firstly	I
,	O
fresh	I
graduates	I
are	I
likely	I
to	I
bring	I
a	I
number	I
of	I
practical	I
and	I
applicable	I
ideas	I
to	I
meet	I
the	I
current	I
needs	I
of	I
the	I
organisation	I
.	I
This	I
is	I
because	I
they	I
have	I
been	I
instilled	I
and	I
imparted	I
the	I
most	I
updated	I
knowledge	I
and	I
skills	I
at	I
universities	I
.	I
Secondly	I
,	O
having	I
a	I
larger	I
proportion	I
of	I
young	I
adults	I
could	I
enhance	I
the	I
working	I
effectiveness	I
and	I
efficiency	I
.	I
Compared	I
with	I
aged	I
staffs	I
,	I
younger	I
employees	I
are	I
often	I
physically	I
stronger	I
and	I
energetic	I
which	I
enables	I
them	I
to	I
carry	I
out	I
heavy	I
workload	I
to	I
meet	I
the	I
deadline	I
.	I
However	I
,	O
sacrificing	I
the	I
senior	I
members	I
to	I
save	I
the	I
young	I
workers	I
poses	I
several	I
negative	I
influences	I
.	I
From	I
personal	I
level	I
,	I
it	I
fosters	I
a	I
sense	I
of	I
unfairness	I
between	I
the	I
older	I
and	I
younger	I
generations	I
.	I
It	I
is	I
undeniable	I
that	I
every	I
person	I
within	I
the	I
business	I
enterprise	I
has	I
the	I
rights	I
to	I
proceed	I
their	I
work	I
as	I
long	I
as	I
they	I
are	I
capable	I
of	I
doing	I
it	I
,	I
disregard	I
the	I
age	I
and	I
physical	I
capacity	I
.	I
From	I
social	I
perspective	I
,	O
massively	I
forcing	I
the	I
early	I
retirement	I
would	I
be	I
one	I
of	I
financial	I
burden	I
to	I
the	I
local	I
government	I
.	I
For	I
example	I
,	O
sufficient	I
pension	I
payments	I
and	I
regular	I
medical	I
care	I
should	I
be	I
given	I
and	I
arranged	I
for	I
the	I
senior	I
citizens	I
after	I
they	I
have	I
been	I
imposed	I
to	I
terminate	I
their	I
employment	I
permanently	I
.	I
In	I
conclusion	O
,	O
even	I
though	I
the	I
introduction	I
of	I
the	I
early	I
retirement	I
has	I
some	I
benefits	I
,	O
it	I
is	I
convincing	I
that	I
it	I
would	I
generate	I
a	I
sense	I
of	I
discrimination	I
among	I
different	I
age	I
groups	I
and	I
increase	I
the	I
government	I
financial	I
pressure	I
accordingly	I
.	I
	O
The	I
Internet	I
is	I
an	I
adequate	I
source	I
of	I
academic	I
information	I
Over	I
the	I
past	I
few	I
decades	I
,	I
the	I

has	I

a	I
long	I
stride	I
in	I
technological	I
modernization	I
,	I
especially	I
in	I
field	I
of	I
education	I

This	I
has	I
enabled	I

to	I
post	I
their	I
lessons	I
on	I
the	I

for	I
the	I
sake	I
of	I

Consequently	I

However	I

the	I

an	I

I	I

for	I
a	I
more	I

First	I

the	I
Internet	I
is	I
an	I
adequate	I

which	I
will	I
potentially	I

the	I

Nowadays	I

as	I

on	I
the	I

As	I
such	I

the	I
Internet	I
has	I
grown	I
to	I
become	I
the	I
largest	I
virtual	I

ever	I

Moreover	I
,	O
with	I
the	I
use	I
of	I
the	I
Internet	I

time	I
seem	I
to	I
be	I
no	I

Last	I
but	I
not	I

,	O
the	I
Internet	I

In	I
the	I

the	I

an	I
indispensable	I

for	I
the	I
enormous	I
benefits	I
that	I

about	I

Have	I
you	I
ever	I

what	I
it	I

a	I

in	I

This	I

out	I
to	I
be	I
true	I
thanks	I
to	I
technical	I
and	I
internet	I
advances	I

Critics	I
may	I
argue	I
that	I
the	I
Internet	I
have	I
several	I
drawbacks	I
which	I
can	I
affect	I
the	I
education	I
system	I
negatively	I
,	I
for	I

internet	I
abuse	I
and	I
black	I

However	I
,	O
we	I
should	I
bear	I
in	I
mind	I
that	I
these	I
problems	I
are	I

students	I
'	I
wrong	I

what	I

After	I

I	I

to	I

the	I
necessity	I

Despite	O

of	I
some	I

that	I

can	I
obtain	I
more	I
useful	I
knowledge	I

from	I

I	I
firmly	I

that	I

It	I
is	I
undeniable	I
that	I
the	I

of	I

has	I
played	I
an	I
important	I
role	I
in	I

Computers	I

these	I

the	I
facts	I

been	I
learned	I
and	I

A	I
case	I
in	I
point	I
is	I
the	I
reading	I
and	I
listening	I
parts	I
of	I
TOEFL	I
iBT	I

as	I
candidates	I
have	I
to	I
answer	I
many	I
questions	I
in	I
a	I

period	I

Moreover	O

when	I

some	I

people	I

any	I

Besides	I
,	O
in	I
the	I
past	I

conducting	I
a	I
research	I
require	I
long	I
hours	I
of	I

in	I

now	I
all	I
can	I
be	I
done	I
at	I
a	I

Thus	I
,	O
technologies	I
are	I
vital	I
in	I
students	I
'	I
learning	I

On	I
the	I
other	I
hand	I
,	O
schools	I
and	I
university	I
are	I
places	I
in	I
which	I
students	I
gather	I
to	I
be	I
educated	I
and	I
learn	I
from	I
each	I
others	I
as	I
well	I
as	I
formal	I
educators	I

At	O

orchestrated	I

their	I
acquisition	I
of	I

is	I
guided	I

backed	I
up	I
in	I
a	I

Therefore	I
,	O
formal	I

To	I
put	I
it	I
all	I
in	I

So	I
students	I
should	I
learn	I
both	I
from	I

to	I

Detailed	I
description	I
of	I
crimes	I
on	I
newspaper	I
and	I
TV	I
can	I
have	I
bad	I
consequences	I
on	I
society	I
Nowadays	I
,	I
the	I
print	I
as	I
well	I
as	I
the	I
electronic	I
media	I
tend	I
to	I
dedicate	I
large	I
amounts	I
of	I
airtime	I
and	I
space	I
to	I
detailed	I
reports	I
about	I
crimes	I
.	I
Personally	I
,	O
I	I
believe	I
such	I
details	I
should	I
be	I
strictly	I
censored	I
,	O
if	I
not	I
banned	I
altogether	I
.	I
It	I
is	I
widely	I
known	I
that	I
the	I
press	I
provide	I
the	I
public	I
with	I
criminal	I
content	I
in	I
order	I
to	I
increase	I
newspaper	I
circulation	I
and	I
TV	I
rating	I
.	I
These	I
days	I
the	I
primary	I
purpose	I
of	I
journalists	I
covering	I
the	I
details	I
of	I
criminal	I
acts	I
is	I
,	I
more	I
often	I
than	I
that	I
,	I
to	I
boost	I
newspaper	I
circulations	I
and	I
TV	I
ratings	I
.	I
Consequently	I
,	O
a	I
great	I
deal	I
of	I
crime	I
coverage	I
is	I
rather	I
biased	I
,	O
exaggerated	I
or	I
fraudulent	I
,	O
which	I
only	I
result	I
to	I
terrorize	I
communities	I
and	I
leave	I
law-aiding	I
people	I
increasingly	I
apprehensive	I
of	I
about	I
crimes	I
.	I
An	O
even	I
more	I
detrimental	I
fact	I
is	I
that	I
detailed	I
reports	I
of	I
crimes	I
exposured	I
on	I
the	I
press	I
may	I
provide	I
the	I
potential	I
criminals	I
with	I
instructive	I
learning	I
materials	I
,	I
which	I
would	I
be	I
hard	I
to	I
obtain	I
otherwise	I
.	I
This	I
may	I
help	I
those	I
who	I
are	I
in	I
the	I
process	I
of	I
panning	I
a	I
criminal	I
act	I
perfect	I
their	I
plans	I
,	I
avoid	I
the	I
pitfalls	I
and	I
make	I
themselves	I
harder	I
to	I
be	I
tracked	I
down	I
by	I
the	I
police	I
.	I
Thus	I
,	O
without	I
the	I
prevention	I
on	I
criminal	I
details	I
,	O
the	I
unlawful	I
behavior	I
would	I
be	I
more	I
and	I
more	I
severe	I
and	I
the	I
social	I
harmony	I
would	I
be	I
broken	I
.	I
Most	I
importantly	I
,	I
particular	I
coverage	I
of	I
heinous	I
crimes	I
may	I
further	I
traumatize	I
the	I
victims	I
of	I
crimes	I
because	I
they	I
have	I
already	I
suffered	I
greatly	I
for	I
what	I
they	I
have	I
experienced	I
.	I
Without	I
their	I
consent	I
,	O
this	I
could	I
only	I
add	I
to	I
theses	I
innocent	I
people	I
's	I
mental	I
suffering	I
and	I
they	I
may	I
do	I
some	I
extreme	I
actions	I
.	I
In	I
conclusion	O
,	O
I	I
strongly	I
hold	I
my	I
point	I
that	I
any	I
descriptions	I
of	I
crimes	I
should	I
not	I
go	I
unchecked	I
as	I
any	I
longer	I
,	O
as	I
they	I
may	I
be	I
false	I
,	O
may	I
further	I
drive	I
up	I
the	I
already-high	I
crime	I
rate	I
and	I
may	I
bring	I
even	I
more	I
suffering	I
to	I
the	I
victims	I
of	I
crimes	I

Working	I
at	I
home	I
vs	I
Working	I
in	I
a	I
company	I
Due	I
to	I
the	I
convenience	I
of	I
current	I
technology	I
,	I
people	I
can	I
do	I
their	I
works	I
everywhere	I
as	I
long	I
as	I
they	I
have	I
the	I
equipment	I
around	I
them	I
.	I
People	I
are	I
no	I
longer	I
restricted	I
in	I
the	I
office	I
.	I
This	I
rapid	I
progress	I
in	I
technology	I
leads	I
to	I
the	I
question	I
whether	I
it	I
's	I
better	I
working	I
at	I
home	I
with	I
a	I
computer	I
and	I
a	I
phone	I
than	I
working	I
at	I
the	I
company	I
's	I
office	I
.	I
In	I
my	I
opinion	I
,	O
I	I
believe	I
that	I
working	I
at	I
home	I
is	I
worse	I
and	I
less	I
efficient	I
than	I
working	I
in	I
the	I
office	I
.	I
First	I
of	I
all	I
,	O
while	I
working	I
in	I
the	I
office	I
,	O
people	I
can	I
interact	I
with	I
their	I
colleges	I
instantly	I
.	I
They	I
can	I
either	I
get	I
help	I
from	I
colleges	I
or	I
discuss	I
about	I
the	I
work	I
together	I
.	I
Think	I
about	I
the	I
big	I
project	I
that	I
a	I
group	I
is	I
working	I
on	I
,	I
if	I
any	I
group	I
member	I
has	I
new	I
idea	I
about	I
the	I
project	I
,	I
he/she	I
can	I
assemble	I
his/her	I
colleges	I
right	I
away	I
and	I
discuss	I
.	I
It	I
's	I
more	I
efficient	I
and	I
straight-forward	I
than	I
talking	I
in	I
the	I
phone	I
.	I
For	I
another	I
example	I
,	O
if	I
one	I
's	I
computer	I
or	I
Internet	I
has	I
any	I
breakdown	I
,	O
he/she	I
can	I
call	I
the	I
MIS	I
staff	I
to	I
fix	I
.	I
Second	I
,	O
working	I
at	I
home	I
has	I
many	I
disadvantages	I
that	I
will	I
no	I
doubt	I
lower	I
the	I
efficiency	I
of	I
works	I
.	I
For	I
example	I
,	O
people	I
are	I
easily	I
distracted	I
while	I
working	I
at	I
home	I
.	I
It	I
's	I
hard	I
to	I
concentrate	I
on	I
work	I
if	I
people	I
can	I
grab	I
the	I
TV	I
remote	I
or	I
some	I
junk	I
foods	I
right	I
away	I
.	I
In	I
addition	I
,	O
while	I
people	I
are	I
working	I
at	I
home	I
,	O
there	I
will	I
be	I
no	I
one	I
supervising	I
them	I
,	O
thus	I
raises	I
the	I
chance	I
of	I
loafing	I
.	I
Moreover	I
,	O
people	I
who	I
work	I
at	I
home	I
are	I
more	I
likely	I
to	I
miss	I
the	I
important	I
events	I
happening	I
in	I
the	I
office	I
,	O
like	I
some	I
announcements	I
from	I
the	I
boss	I
.	I
In	I
conclusion	I
,	O
working	I
in	I
the	I
office	I
is	I
obviously	I
better	I
than	I
working	I
at	I
home	I
in	I
terms	I
of	I
efficiency	I
.	I
It	I
not	I
only	I
has	I
the	I
advantage	I
of	I
working	I
with	I
colleges	I
but	I
also	I
it	I
provides	I
a	I
real	I
working	I
atmosphere	I
that	I
can	I
never	I
be	I
grasped	I
if	I
people	I
choose	I
to	I
work	I
at	I
home	I
.	I
The	I
best	I
way	I
to	I
relax	I
is	I
by	I
exercises	I
In	I
modern	I
society	I
,	I
people	I
often	I
face	I
many	I
difficulties	I
under	I
great	I
stress	I
.	I
Therefore	I
,	O
it	I
is	I
necessary	I
for	I
many	I
to	I
find	I
ways	I
to	I
relax	I
.	I
Although	I
miscellaneous	I
people	I
may	I
apply	I
diverse	I
strategies	I
,	O
such	I
as	I
reading	I
,	O
watching	I
movies	I
,	O
or	I
working	I
in	I
their	I
gardens	I
,	O
I	I
argue	I
that	I
the	I
most	I
suitable	I
method	I
of	I
reducing	I
stress	I
for	I
modern	I
people	I
is	I
by	I
different	I
kinds	I
of	I
exercise	I
,	O
which	I
can	I
not	I
only	I
improve	I
health	I
conditions	I
but	I
also	I
bring	I
positive	I
emotions	I
.	I
It	I
is	I
not	I
surprised	I
that	I
exercise	I
play	I
a	I
crucial	I
role	I
in	I
ameliorating	I
physical	I
health	I
.	I
Any	I
kinds	I
of	I
sports	I
,	O
such	I
as	I
jogging	I
,	O
swimming	I
,	O
or	I
playing	I
basketball	I
,	O
can	I
effectively	I
facilitate	I
human	I
respiration	I
and	I
circulation	I
system	I
.	I
Moreover	I
,	O
these	I
sports	I
can	I
also	I
strengthen	I
muscles	I
and	I
lessen	I
surplus	I
adipose	I
tissues	I
in	I
human	I
body	I
.	I
The	I
latter	I
one	I
is	I
of	I
particular	I
importance	I
because	I
nowadays	I
more	I
and	I
more	I
people	I
are	I
suffer	I
from	I
obesity	I
.	I
Many	I
studies	I
has	I
points	I
out	I
that	I
numbers	I
of	I
overweight	I
people	I
have	I
increased	I
in	I
developed	I
countries	I
in	I
recent	I
years	I
,	I
which	I
mainly	I
results	I
from	I
insufficient	I
exercises	I
.	I
Sports	I
activities	I
can	I
improve	I
mental	I
health	I
as	I
well	I
.	I
When	I
people	I
exercise	I
,	I
the	I
neuron	I
cells	I
in	I
the	I
brain	I
release	I
a	I
chemical	I
compound	I
named	I
Dopamine	I
.	I
This	I
hormone	I
can	I
delight	I
one	I
's	I
mind	I
,	I
creating	I
positive	I
feelings	I
.	I
Thus	I
good	I
exercises	I
can	I
often	I
successfully	I
alleviating	I
one	I
's	I
heavy	I
burdens	I
.	I
Moreover	I
,	O
rigorous	I
exercise	I
can	I
also	I
hone	I
one	I
's	I
will	I
,	O
which	I
enable	I
people	I
to	I
be	I
able	I
to	I
tackle	I
stringent	I
problems	I
and	I
arduous	I
tasks	I
.	I
In	I
a	I
nutshell	I
,	I
many	I
activities	I
can	I
let	I
humans	I
relax	I
.	I
Nevertheless	I
,	O
I	I
assert	I
that	I
the	I
best	I
way	I
of	I
diminishing	I
stress	I
is	I
by	I
exercises	I
,	O
which	I
can	I
benefit	I
everyone	I
not	I
only	I
physically	I
but	I
also	I
mentally	I
.	I
The	I
precondition	I
of	I
doing	I
research	I
by	I
professors	I
Nowadays	I
,	I
many	I
professors	I
conduct	I
research	I
while	I
teaching	I
in	I
colleges	I
or	I
universities	I
.	I
Although	I
research	I
could	I
bring	I
funding	I
and	I
latest	I
achievements	I
in	I
the	I
field	I
,	I
the	I
research	I
takes	I
up	I
too	I
much	I
teaching	I
time	I
.	I
As	I
far	I
as	I
I	I
am	I
concerned	I
,	O
professors	I
should	I
spend	I
more	I
time	I
on	I
preparing	I
courses	I
than	I
research	I
.	I
To	I
begin	I
with	I
,	O
it	I
is	I
vital	I
that	I
professors	I
should	I
assist	I
students	I
to	I
acquire	I
knowledge	I
.	I
The	I
professors	I
'	I
duty	I
is	I
to	I
nurture	I
students	I
,	I
and	I
prepare	I
excellent	I
courses	I
.	I
If	I
professors	I
spend	I
a	I
lot	I
of	I
time	I
on	I
research	I
,	I
he	I
will	I
cut	I
the	I
time	I
on	I
preparing	I
courses	I
is	I
reduced	I
,	I
which	I
may	I
decrease	I
the	I
quality	I
of	I
classes	I
.	I
The	I
reason	I
why	I
people	I
enter	I
a	I
university	I
is	I
that	I
they	I
want	I
to	I
learn	I
cutting-edged	I
technologies	I
.	I
In	I
this	I
way	I
,	O
professors	I
should	I
provide	I
well-preparation	I
courses	I
to	I
convey	I
the	I
state-of-art	I
knowledge	I
for	I
college	I
and	I
university	I
students	I
.	I
Therefore	I
,	O
professors	I
should	I
pay	I
more	I
attention	I
on	I
how	I
to	I
teach	I
students	I
rather	I
than	I
conduct	I
research	I
.	I
On	I
the	I
other	I
hand	I
,	O
if	I
professors	I
are	I
busy	I
in	I
doing	I
research	I
,	O
ignoring	I
preparing	I
appropriate	I
courses	I
for	I
students	I
,	O
it	I
would	I
ruin	I
the	I
reputation	I
of	I
universities	I
.	I
Students	I
are	I
unsatisfied	I
with	I
the	I
unprepared	I
course	I
,	I
and	I
the	I
enrollment	I
of	I
universities	I
may	I
decline	I
.	I
Many	I
students	I
would	I
not	I

In	I
this	I
way	I
,	O
hardly	I
can	I
professors	I
find	I
assistants	I
to	I
help	I
with	I
projects	I

It	I
is	I
adverse	I

academic	I
field	I

Accordingly	I
,	O
spending	I
more	I
time	I
to	I
nurture	I
excellent	I
students	I
is	I
more	I
consequential	I
to	I
professors	I
,	O
rather	I
than	I
research	I
.	I
Nevertheless	I
,	O
professors	I
could	I
teach	I
students	I
through	I
research	I
and	I
projects	I

Some	I
students	I
enjoy	I
taking	I
part	I
in	I
some	I
research	I

Through	I
to	I
use	I
the	I

,	I
they	I
may	I
get	I
more	I
experience	I
in	I
the	I
process	I
of	I
research	I

For	I
instance	I
,	O
electronic	I
students	I
always	I
invent	I
new	I
machines	I
such	I
as	I
robots	I
,	O
MP3	I
and	I
remote	I
control	I
car	I

They	I
can	I
manage	I
the	I
electric	I
theory	I
in	I
practical	I
skills	I
.	I
And	I
some	I
students	I
will	I
be	I
rewarded	I
by	I
investing	I
new	I
inventions	I

However	I
,	O
only	I
under	I
specific	I
circumstance	I
,	O
when	I
students	I
master	I
all	I
of	I
the	I
systematic	I
knowledge	I
,	O
can	I
they	I
accomplish	I
research	I
.	I
This	I
is	I
requires	I
professors	I
provide	I
high	I
quality	I
courses	I
.	I
In	I
other	I
word	I
,	I
professor	I
should	I
concern	I
about	I
preparing	I
class	I

Consequently	I
,	O
conducting	I
research	I
is	I
helpful	I
for	I
professors	I
and	I
students	I
to	I
some	I
extent	I
.	I
However	I
,	O
the	I
precondition	I
of	I
doing	I
research	I
is	I
growing	I
students	I
'	I
solid	I
theory	I
fundamental	I

Only	I
by	I
developing	I
students	I
,	I
can	I
we	I
have	I
a	I
better	I
academic	I
field	I
.	I
Professors	I

Children	I
engagement	I
in	I
paid	I
work	I
In	I
many	I
countries	I
,	O
children	I
are	I
educated	I
from	I
their	I
young	I
age	I
to	I
be	I
independent	I
and	I
responsible	I
for	I
their	I
actions	I
.	I
Their	I
parents	I
allow	I
them	I
to	I
take	I
some	I
jobs	I
because	I
these	I
jobs	I
can	I
help	I
them	I
learn	I
and	I
take	I
responsibilities	I
.	I
However	I
,	O
some	I
people	I
think	I
it	I
's	I
not	I
a	I
good	I
educational	I
measure	I
.	I
From	I
my	I
point	I
of	I
view	I
,	O
the	I
benefits	I
of	I
children	I
engagement	I
in	I
paid	I
work	I
outweigh	I
its	I
drawbacks	I
.	I
First	I
of	I
all	I
,	O
children	I
can	I
learn	I
about	I
the	I
hardship	I
of	I
earning	I
money	I
.	I
When	I
they	I
take	I
some	I
kind	I
of	I
paid	I
work	I
such	I
as	I
looking	I
after	I
babies	I
,	O
doing	I
housework	I
and	I
keeping	I
shops	I
,	O
they	I
will	I
have	I
some	I
life	I
experience	I
and	I
skills	I
which	I
make	I
them	I
mature	I
and	I
can	I
deal	I
with	I
many	I
different	I
situations	I
in	I
real	I
life	I
.	I
Therefore	I
,	O
they	I
are	I
likely	I
to	I
understand	I
their	I
parents	I
'	I
hardship	I
,	O
to	I
respect	I
values	I
of	I
money	I
and	I
to	I
form	I
a	I
good	I
habit	I
of	I
saving	I
.	I
Secondly	I
,	O
when	I
children	I
take	I
jobs	I
,	O
they	I
tend	I
to	I
be	I
more	I
responsible	I
because	I
whether	I
they	I
can	I
earn	I
money	I
or	I
not	I
will	I
depend	I
on	I
their	I
effectiveness	I
and	I
attitudes	I
in	I
working	I
.	I
To	I
keep	I
their	I
jobs	I
,	O
children	I
will	I
have	I
to	I
try	I
their	I
best	I
to	I
finish	I
their	I
duties	I
.	I
For	I
example	I
,	O
if	I
a	I
child	I
works	I
as	I
a	I
shop	I
assistant	I
,	O
he	I
will	I
have	I
to	I
keep	I
an	I
eye	I
on	I
good	I
and	I
products	I
,	O
calculate	I
prices	I
correctly	I
and	I
take	I
responsibilities	I
for	I
any	I
lost	I
.	I
Some	I
people	I
may	I
argue	I
that	I
children	I
will	I
be	I
more	I
material	I
,	I
neglect	I
their	I
study	I
for	I
earning	I
money	I
or	I
be	I
exploited	I
by	I
the	I
employers	I
.	I
However	I
,	O
if	I
children	I
get	I
good	I
care	I
and	I
instructions	I
from	I
their	I
parents	I
,	O
they	I
can	I
take	I
advantages	I
of	I
the	I
work	I
to	I
learn	I
valuable	I
things	I
and	I
avoid	I
going	I
in	I
a	I
wrong	I
way	I
.	I
In	I
conclusion	I
,	O
if	I
children	I
take	I
part	I
in	I
some	I
kind	I
of	I
paid	I
work	I
with	I
their	I
parents	I
'	I
permission	I
,	O
they	I
can	I
learn	I
lively	I
lessons	I
and	I
become	I
mature	I
and	I
responsible	I
.	I
I	I
recommend	O
that	I
parents	I
should	I
help	I
their	I
children	I
to	I
choose	I
a	I
suitable	I
job	I
which	I
does	I
not	I
affect	I
their	I
children	I
's	I
study	I
and	I
that	I
the	I
government	I
should	I
have	I
right	I
policies	I
to	I
avoid	I
exploiting	I
children	I
's	I
labour	I
.	I
	O
New	I
building	I
construction	I
hold	I
the	I
right	I
to	I
gain	I
more	I
money	I
from	I
government	I
The	I
housing	I

is	I
drawing	I
more	I
and	I

attention	I
nowadays	I

And	I
the	I
cost	I
of	I

growing	I
these	I
years	I

The	I
necessity	I
of	I
governmental	I
financial	I
aid	I
is	I
extremely	I
important	I
.	I
What	I
government	I
should	I
take	I
into	I
consideration	I
at	I
the	I
first	I
place	I
should	I
not	I
be	I
historic	I

Building	I

if	I

If	I
the	I
price	I
of	I

grows	I
continuously	I
,	I
a	I
comfortable	I
place	I
to	I
live	I

be	I
a	I
luxury	I
to	I
the	I

Then	I

and	I
I	I
am	I
sure	I
that	I
it	I
will	I
increase	I
people	I
's	I
dissatisfaction	I
of	I
the	I
government	I

Because	I
when	I
they	I
are	I
working	I

the	I
fair	I
of	I
losing	I
their	I

always	I
lingers	I
,	O
which	I
will	I
limit	I
their	I
efficiency	I

And	O
government	I
should	I
spend	I
money	I
on	I
people	I
to	I

them	I
from	I
this	I

because	I
only	I
a	I

finally	I

people	I
's	I
cohesiveness	I
will	I
be	I
promoted	I

Otherwise	I
,	I
another	I
vital	I
reason	I
why	I
new	I
building	I
construction	I
deserves	I
more	I
governmental	I
investment	I
lies	I
in	I
the	I
fact	I
that	I
it	I
requires	I
far	I
more	I
resource	I
compare	I
to	I
old	I
building	I
preservation	I
.	I
Build	I
a	I
new	I
building	I
has	I
following	I
prerequisites	I

land	I
that	I
has	I
been	I
sold	I
by	I
the	I
government	I
via	I
formal	I
procedures	I

a	I
reliable	I
construction	I
company	I
and	I
tremendous	I
amount	I
of	I
labor	I

Except	I
these	I
,	O
hundreds	I
of	I
problems	I
would	I
occur	I
during	I
the	I
construction	I
.	I
Thus	I
,	O
only	I
government	I
can	I
cope	I
with	I
it	I
by	I
utilizing	I
its	I
enormous	I
resource	I
like	I
dollars	I
and	I
effectiveness	I
.	I
Generally	I
,	O
personally	I
speaking	I
,	O
I	I
believe	I
new	I
building	I
construction	I
hold	I
the	I
right	I
to	I
gain	I
more	I
money	I
from	I
government	I

Technology	I
helps	I
student	I
learn	I
more	I
information	I
and	I
learn	I
more	I
quickly	I
?	O
Nowadays	I
,	O
technology	I
plays	I
an	I
indispensable	I
role	I
in	I
almost	I
all	I
spheres	I
of	I
life	I

In	I
education	I

it	I
is	I
believed	I
that	I

From	I
my	I
viewpoint	I
,	O
the	I
richness	I
as	I
well	I
as	I
convenience	I
of	I
technology	I
are	I
two	I
main	I
factors	I
that	I
contribute	I
to	I
the	I
students	I
'	I
progress	I

To	I
start	I
with	I
,	O
since	I
technology	I
was	I
introduced	I
,	O
student	I
have	I
been	I
exposed	I
to	I
a	I
wide	I
range	I
of	I
information	I
,	O
which	I
neccessarily	I
broaden	I
their	I
minds	I
.	I
The	I
internet	I
,	O
for	I
example	I
,	O
provide	I
knowledge	I
in	I
the	I
form	I
of	I
news	I
,	O

talks	I
,	O
tapes	I
or	I
reseachs	I
on	I
any	I
particular	I
fields	I
.	I
There	I
,	O
the	I
students	I
can	I
not	I
only	I
ascertain	I
concerned	I
subjects	I
but	I
they	I
can	I
also	I
get	I
access	I
to	I
relevant	I
issues	I
and	I
discuss	I
with	I
people	I
worldwide	I
.	I
Another	I
point	I
that	I
students	I
may	I
benefit	I
from	I
technology	I
is	I
the	I
shortened	I
time	I
for	I
learning	I

The	I
modern	I
world	I
provides	I
learners	I
with	I
the	I
mp3	I

the	I
mobile	I

the	I

that	I

language	I
learners	I
,	O
listen	I
to	I
recordings	I
everywhre	I
or	I
read	I
documents	I

Therefore	I
,	O
students	I
will	I
develop	I
their	I
skills	I
at	I
a	I
greater	I
pace	I

Moreover	O

Common	I
belief	I
that	I
a	I

should	I

fostered	I
some	I
lawyers	I
to	I
protest	I
against	I
the	I
current	I
rules	I
in	I
those	I
two	I
countries	I

Many	I
people	I
hold	I
the	I
opinion	I
that	I
past	I

determines	I
the	I
future	I
actions	I

which	I
could	I

the	I
main	I

support	I
the	I
idea	I
of	I
revealing	I
the	I

to	I
the	I
jury	I

We	I
must	I
acknowledge	I
that	I
complete	I
data	I
concerning	I
the	I
history	I
of	I
a	I
sued	I
person	I
creates	I
more	I
opportunity	I
for	I
jury	I
members	I
to	I
build	I
an	I
overall	I
picture	I
of	I
defendant	I
's	I
personality	I

Furthermore	I
,	O
past	I
record	I
might	I
be	I
useful	I
to	I
decide	I
whether	I
a	I
person	I
was	I
able	I
to	I
perform	I
a	I
certain	I
type	I
of	I
crime	I
when	I
it	I
concerns	I
serious	I
crimes	I
,	O
such	I
as	I
kidnapping	I

a	I

Nevertheless	I
,	O
in	I
order	I
for	I
the	I
jury	I
to	I
come	I
up	I
with	I
an	I
objective	I
decision	I
not	I
depending	I
on	I
the	I
past	I
experience	I
,	O
the	I
court	I
should	I
provide	I
with	I
details	I
relevant	I
to	I
a	I
particular	I
case	I
only	I
.	I
For	I
instance	I
,	O
a	I
defendant	I
with	I
number	I
of	I
past	I
crimes	I
has	I
more	I
chance	I
to	I
be	I
found	I
guilty	I
compared	I
to	I
a	I
person	I
with	I
no	I
or	I
lighter	I
criminal	I
record	I

Innocent	I
suspects	I
,	I
eventually	I

decision	I

pay	I
twice	I
for	I
their	I
previous	I
inadequate	I
actions	I

In	I
conclusion	I
,	O
I	I
am	I
skeptical	I
about	I
disclosing	I
the	I
defendant	I
's	I
history	I
to	I
the	I
jury	I

with	I
intention	I
to	I
avoid	I
subjective	I
and	I
probable	I
inaccurate	I
verdict	I

Thus	I
,	O
I	I
strongly	I
support	I
the	I
current	I
laws	I
of	I
Great	I
Britain	I
and	I
Australia	I
,	O
and	I
would	I
not	I
change	I
the	I

Many	I

.	I
If	I
I	I
could	I
not	I
communicate	I
with	I
other	I
people	I
,	I
I	I
could	I
not	I
even	I
buy	I
food	I
to	I
sacrifice	I
my	I
hunger	I
.	I
This	I
environment	I
makes	I
me	I
want	I
to	I
develop	I
myself	I
to	I
be	I
able	I
to	I
communicate	I
with	I
people	I
that	I
speak	I
foreign	I
language	I
.	I
Secondly	I
,	O
having	I
friend	I
that	I
speaks	I
another	I
language	I
is	I
help	I
people	I
to	I
professional	I
in	I
that	I
language	I
faster	I
.	I
For	I
instance	I
,	O
English	I
school	I
in	I
outside	I
my	I
home	I
country	I
,	O
there	I
are	I
many	I
people	I
that	I
come	I
from	I
different	I
places	I
and	I
from	I
different	I
languages	I
.	I
The	I
only	I
language	I
that	I
I	I
could	I
talk	I
to	I
make	I
friends	I
is	I
English	I
language	I
.	I
Thus	I
,	O
I	I
could	I
talk	I
with	I
my	I
friend	I
without	I
worrying	I
about	I
speaking	I
wrong	I
.	I
This	I
reason	I
makes	I
me	I
have	I
a	I
progress	I
in	I
foreign	I
language	I
faster	I
.	I
In	I
conclusion	I
,	O
I	I
personally	I
believe	I
that	I
learning	I
language	I
from	I
foreign	I
country	I
is	I
better	I
than	I
learning	I
language	I
in	I
home	I
country	I
because	I
I	I
have	I
to	I
improve	I
myself	I
to	I
communicate	I
with	I
other	I
people	I
.	I
Besides	I
,	O
in	I
foreign	I
country	I
I	I
could	I
have	I
a	I
chance	I
to	I
speak	I
foreign	I
language	I
with	I
my	I
friends	I
.	I
Learning	I
foreign	I
language	I
form	I
another	I
country	I
is	I
better	I
choice	I
for	I
me	I
to	I
study	I
language	I

Using	I
a	I
computer	I
every	I
day	I
can	I

more	I
negative	I

In	I
today	I

an	I
essential	I
part	I
of	I

Around	I
the	I

the	I

on	I

It	I
is	I

that	I

a	I
negative	I
way	I
if	I
they	I
use	I
a	I
computer	I
on	I
a	I
daily	I
basis	I

This	I
will	I
be	I
proven	I
by	I
analyzing	I
how	I

children	I
to	I
use	I
vast	I
resources	I

The	I
best	O
thing	O
about	I
internet	I
is	I
the	I
availability	I
of	I
information	I
in	I
the	I
form	I
of	I
text	I
,	O
image	I
or	I
video	I

everything	I

to	I
gather	I
knowledge	I
on	I
the	I
subjects	I
they	I
are	I
studying	I

they	I
are	I
interested	I
about	I

As	I
an	I
example	I
,	O
students	I
preparing	I
for	I
delivering	I
speech	I
on	I
a	I
certain	I
topic	I
can	I
browse	I
through	I

to	I
learn	I
each	I
and	I
every	I
minute	I
details	I
of	I
the	I
subject	I
matter	I
.	I
It	I
's	I
hard	I
to	I
get	I
everything	I
at	I
a	I
same	I
place	I
unless	I
children	I
are	I
not	I
familiar	I
with	I
computers	I

That	I
is	I
how	I
,	I
computer	I
impacts	I
children	I
on	I
a	I
positive	I
note	I

Nowadays	I
,	I
computers	I
enable	I

pictures	I
,	I
document	I
thesis	I
in	I
a	I
simple	I

efficient	I
way	I
.	I
When	I
children	I
are	I
allowed	I
to	I
play	I
around	I
with	I
computer	I
from	I
a	I
very	I
early	I
age	I
,	I
they	I
get	I
acquainted	I
with	I
the	I
previously	I
mentioned	I
skills	I
and	I
become	I
expert	I
before	I
facing	I
professional	I
world	I

For	I

students	I
who	I
used	I
to	I
prepare	I
Microsoft	I
PowerPoint	I
presentation	I
for	I
their	I
school	I
projects	I

get	I
an	I
edge	I
over	I
others	I
at	I
an	I
early	I
stage	I
of	I
their	I
career	I
.	I
From	I
this	I
,	O
it	I
's	I
clear	I
that	I
computer	I
has	I
a	I
positive	I
effect	I
on	I
the	I
children	I
.	I
Following	I
the	I
demonstration	I
of	I
a	I
computer	I
's	I
contribution	I
in	I
children	I
's	I
study	I
and	I
building	I
skills	I
which	I
are	I
to	I
be	I
used	I
in	I
their	I
career	I
afterwards	I
,	I
it	I
is	I
agreed	I
that	I
computer	I
is	I
a	I
boon	I
to	I
children	I
.	I
However	I
,	O
parents	I
should	I
advise	I
and	I
guide	I
their	I
children	I
properly	I
so	I
that	I
they	I
do	I
n't	I
get	I
misled	I

Attending	I
boys	I
and	I
girls	I
in	I
a	I

school	I
would	I
bring	I
many	I
advantages	I
Women	I
or	I
men	I
almost	I
need	I
each	I
other	I
in	I
full	I
of	I
life	I
even	I
in	I
school	I
.	I
Although	I
some	I
experts	I
believe	I
that	I
common	I
schools	I
for	I
both	I
female	I
and	I
male	I
lead	I
to	I
diminish	I
their	I
efficiency	I
in	I
education	I

others	I
view	I
it	I
as	I
a	I
helpful	I
way	I
to	I
recognize	I
the	I
opposite	I
gender	I
.	I
In	I
my	I
opinion	I
,	O
boys	I
and	I
girls	I
should	I
study	I
together	I
in	I
the	I
sense	I
that	I
they	I
have	I
a	I
chance	I
to	I
know	I
each	I
other	I
and	I
learn	I
how	I
to	I
behave	I
with	I
an	I
opposite	I
sex	I

School	I
is	I
a	I
small	I
society	I
for	I
students	I
,	I
which	I
prepares	I
them	I
for	I
the	I
future	I
life	I
.	I
By	I
attending	I
to	I
the	I
same	I
school	I
,	O
students	I
can	I
learn	I
how	I
to	I
view	I
the	I
opposite	I
gender	I
in	I
classes	I
as	I
a	I
friend	I
or	I
a	I
classmate	I
.	I
In	I
addition	I
,	O
a	I
boy	I
would	I
know	I
how	I
to	I
speak	I
with	I
a	I
girl	I
in	I
every	I
situation	I
and	I
vice	I

They	I
would	I
know	I
how	I
to	I
ask	I
her	I
in	I

to	I
cooperate	I
with	I
his	I
study	I
,	I
how	I
communicate	I
with	I
girls	I
in	I
a	I
group	I
,	O
etc	I
.	I
Admittedly	I
,	O
when	I
they	I
study	I
together	I
and	I
help	I
each	I
other	I
,	O
they	I
exercise	I
the	I
the	I
real	I
life	I
as	I
they	I
age	I
.	I
By	I
contrast	I
,	O
some	I
experts	I
believe	I
that	I
attending	I
both	I
girls	I
and	I
boys	I
in	I
a	I
same	I
school	I
cause	I
many	I
disadvantages	I
for	I
them	I
.	I
By	O
doing	I
this	I
,	O
outdoors	I
relationships	I
may	I
expand	I
and	I
it	I
may	I
accompany	I
with	I
sexual	I
relationship	I
and	I
as	I
result	I
,	O
their	I
thoughts	I
deviate	I
from	I
the	I
studies	I
.	I
Moreover	I
,	O
attending	I
in	I
the	I
school	I
having	I
boys	I
and	I
girls	I
might	I
be	I
beneficial	I
for	I
both	I
to	I
increase	I
their	I
motivation	I
to	I
study	I
better	I
.	I
Boys	I
and	I
girls	I
will	I
try	I
to	I
show	I
their	I
capabilities	I
and	I
abilities	I
in	I
the	I
class	I
,	I
therefore	I
they	I
will	I
study	I
increasingly	I
.	I
Indeed	I
,	I
Boys	I
do	I
not	I
like	I
to	I
seem	I
weak	I
in	I
front	I
of	I
girls	I
and	I
vice	I

.	I
As	I
a	I
result	I
,	I
the	I
productivity	I
of	I
the	I
class	I
will	I
be	I
increased	I
.	I
In	I
a	I
word	I
,	O
attending	I
boys	I
and	I
girls	I
in	I
a	I
same	I
school	I
would	I
bring	I
many	I
advantages	I
.	I
Taking	I
part	I
in	I
the	I
study	I
groups	I
would	I
increase	I
student	I
's	I
motivation	I
to	I
study	I
more	I
.	I
In	I
addition	I
,	O
they	I
would	I
be	I
able	I
to	I
know	I
the	I
opposite	I
gender	I
,	O
which	I
help	I
them	I
to	I
be	I
prepared	I
for	I
the	I
adult	I
life	I
where	I
they	I
almost	I
will	I
live	I
or	I
work	I
together	I
.	I
Some	O
important	I
characteristics	I
of	I
a	I
co-worker	I
At	I
work	I
,	O
you	I
meet	I
people	I
with	I
diverse	I
backgrounds	I
and	I
you	I
are	I
required	I
to	I
maintain	I
sound	I
relationships	I
with	I
many	I
of	I
them	I
in	I
order	I
to	I
have	I
a	I
pleasant	I
work	I
environment	I
.	I
However	I
,	O
the	I
relationship	I
you	I
need	I
to	I
maintain	I
with	I
your	I
co-worker	I
is	I
the	I
most	I
important	I
one	I
since	I
he	I
or	I
she	I
is	I
the	I
person	I
who	I
works	I
very	I
closely	I
with	I
you	I
,	O
and	I
in	I
most	I
instances	I
you	I
have	I
to	I
rely	I
on	I
him	I
or	I
her	I
.	I
Therefore	I
in	I
my	I
view	I
,	O
a	I
good	I
co-worker	I
needs	I
to	I
have	I
three	I
most	I
important	I
characteristics	I
such	I
as	I
cooperation	I
,	O
trustworthiness	I
,	I
and	I
fellowship	I
.	I
The	I
co-workers	I
should	I
be	I
cooperative	I
with	I
one	I
another	I
.	I
If	I
they	I
do	I
not	I
cooperate	I
,	I
there	I
will	I
be	I
lots	I
of	I
disputes	I
.	I
I	I
once	I
had	I
a	I
co-worker	I
who	I
was	I
too	I
family	I
conscious	I
.	I
Therefore	I
he	I
always	I
left	I
office	I
sharp	I
on	I
time	I
without	I
giving	I
any	I
consideration	I
whether	I
the	I
work	I
has	I
been	I
finished	I
or	I
not	I
.	I
Most	I
of	I
the	I
time	I
,	O
I	I
had	I
to	I
do	I
his	I
work	I
in	I
order	I
to	I
protect	I
him	I
from	I
getting	I
caught	I
to	I
the	I
supervisor	I
who	I
was	I
a	I
very	I
authoritative	I
person	I
.	I
However	I
,	O
one	I
day	I
I	I
wanted	I
to	I
be	I
off	I
early	I
because	I
I	I
had	I
to	I
take	I
my	I
mother	I
to	I
the	I
doctor	I
.	I
When	I
I	I
requested	I
my	I
co-worker	I
to	I
give	I
a	I
helping	I
hand	I
to	I
finish	I
my	I
work	I
early	I
,	I
he	I
turned	I
down	I
my	I
request	I
giving	I
a	I
silly	I
excuse	I
.	I
From	I
that	I
day	I
onwards	I
I	I
did	I
not	I
offer	I
him	I
any	I
support	I
and	I
finally	I
he	I
was	I
transferred	I
from	I
our	I
department	I
to	I
a	I
distant	I
location	I
as	I
a	I
punishment	I
for	I
his	I
irresponsibility	I
.	I
Therefore	I
,	O
I	I
believe	I
if	I
the	I
co-workers	I
do	I
not	I
corporate	I
with	I
each	I
other	I
that	I
would	I
be	I
devastating	I
in	I
a	I
work	I
environment	I
.	I
The	I
co-workers	I
need	I
to	I
trust	I
each	I
other	I
.	I
They	I
should	I
not	I
act	I
on	I
suspicion	I
.	I
This	I
is	I
a	I
very	I
important	I
aspect	I
in	I
the	I
work	I
environment	I
.	I
I	I
came	I
across	I
a	I
situation	I
once	I
such	I
that	I
one	I
of	I
my	I
subordinates	I
used	I
to	I
suspect	I
his	I
co-worker	I
for	I
carrying	I
tales	I
to	I
me	I
.	I
To	I
a	I
certain	I
extent	I
his	I
suspicion	I
was	I
valid	I
as	I
his	I
co-worker	I
made	I
several	I
attempts	I
to	I
highlight	I
the	I
drawbacks	I
of	I
him	I
.	I
However	I
I	I
never	I
encourage	I
tale	I
carriers	I
as	I
a	I
principle	I
and	I
therefore	I
his	I
co-worker	I
gave	I
up	I
talking	I
ill	I
against	I
him	I
with	I
me	I
.	I
But	I
this	I
mistrust	I
continued	I
and	I
created	I
very	I
unpleasant	I
situations	I
for	I
everybody	I
in	I
my	I
department	I
.	I
Finally	I
,	O
the	I
co-workers	I
should	I
believe	I
in	I
fellowship	I
.	I
This	I
helps	I
them	I
to	I
enjoy	I
their	I
work	I
life	I
while	I
building	I
up	I
very	I
strong	I
personal	I
relationships	I
.	I
After	I
all	I
,	I
you	I
spend	I
most	I
of	I
your	I
day	I
at	I
office	I
.	I
If	I
you	I
have	I
a	I
good	I
company	I
in	I
office	I
,	I
it	I
is	I
certainly	I
a	I
blessing	I
.	I
The	I
advertising	I
is	I
the	I
main	I
cause	I
of	I
unhealthy	I
eating	I
habits	I
Advertising	I
is	I
becoming	I
part	I
of	I
our	I
modern	I
society	I
.	I
They	I
penetrate	I
into	I
people	I
's	I
life	I
,	I
affecting	I
people	I
's	I
choices	I
in	I
different	I
things	I
.	I
Therefore	I
,	O
it	I
comes	I
to	I
the	I
debate	I
whether	I
advertising	I
has	I
positive	I
influences	I
on	I
people	I
's	I
life	I
.	I
Some	I
people	I
say	I
that	I
advertising	I
must	I
be	I
blamed	I
for	I
the	I
unhealthy	I
eating	I
habits	I
,	I
while	I
others	I
believe	I
that	I
there	I
are	I
still	I
some	I
other	I
factors	I
directing	I
people	I
's	I
judgments	I
.	I
In	I
my	I
opinion	I
,	O
the	I
advertising	I
is	I
not	I
the	I
main	I
cause	I
of	I
unhealthy	I
eating	I
habits	I
.	I
First	I
of	I
all	I
,	O
advertising	I
is	I
not	I
entirely	I
decisive	I
on	I
personal	I
eating	I
habit	I
.	I
The	I
key	I
to	I
forming	I
a	I
healthy	I
eating	I
pattern	I
lies	I
in	I
people	I
's	I
concept	I
of	I
wholesome	I
diets	I
and	I
self-control	I
.	I
It	I
is	I
sure	I
that	I
advertising	I
always	I
makes	I
the	I
products	I
so	I
tempting	I
,	I
regardless	I
of	I
whether	I
they	I
might	I
bring	I
negative	I
effects	I
on	I
the	I
human	I
body	I
.	I
However	I
,	O
advertising	I
is	I
not	I
the	I
only	I
information	I
source	I
for	I
people	I
.	I
People	I
can	I
still	I
acquire	I
different	I
viewpoints	I
about	I
foods	I
from	I
other	I
sources	I
,	I
like	I
news	I
or	I
magazines	I
.	I
As	I
long	I
as	I
people	I
are	I
clear	I
about	I
how	I
to	I
maintain	I
a	I
healthy	I
body	I
and	I
they	I
persistently	I
keep	I
track	I
of	I
their	I
eating	I
habits	I
,	I
they	I
can	I
successfully	I
prevent	I
themselves	I
from	I
those	I
temptations	I
.	I
It	I
will	I
be	I
not	I
persuasive	I
if	I
people	I
just	I
blame	I
the	I
advertising	I
sector	I
of	I
a	I
fast-food	I
company	I
for	I
making	I
them	I
so	I
fat	I
and	I
not	I
reassess	I
their	I
own	I
behaviors	I
.	I
Second	I
,	O
in	I
the	I
era	I
when	I
people	I
are	I
becoming	I
conscious	I
of	I
a	I

The	I
main	I
advantage	I

high-tech	I

is	I
that	I

are	I
better	I
taken	I

that	I
they	I

health	I

They	I
can	I

do	I
not	I
have	I
to	I

time	I
in	I

so	I
this	I

an	I

In	I
addition	I
,	O
a	I
community	I
with	I
the	I

who	I
have	I
a	I
good	I

has	I
a	I
major	I
role	I

in	I
a	I

as	I
their	I

It	I
can	I
be	I
said	I
that	I
the	I
improvement	I
of	I
medical	I
care	I
makes	I
a	I
better	I
life	I
for	I
all	I
people	I
.	I
On	O
the	I
other	I
hand	I
,	O
some	I
people	I
maintain	I
that	I
the	I
increase	I
in	I
life	I
expectancy	I
puts	I
a	I
high	I
pressure	I
on	I
the	I
economic	I
system	I
because	I
more	I

have	I
to	I
spend	I
for	I
Medicare	I
instead	I
of	I
investing	I
in	I
other	I
sectors	I
of	I
the	I
economic	I
system	I
.	I
Although	I
it	I
is	I
real	I
in	I
some	I
aspects	I
,	O
I	I
believe	I
that	I
the	I
capital	I
that	I
spend	I
on	I
taking	I
care	I
the	I
elderly	I
is	I
contributed	I
by	I
these	I
people	I
during	I
their	I
working	I
time	I
,	O
so	I
they	I
are	I
worth	I
to	I
have	I
good	I
care	I
.	I
They	I
have	I
given	I
their	I
effort	I
to	I
the	I
society	I
so	I
that	I
young	I
people	I

the	I
governments	I
have	I
a	I
responsibility	I
to	I
improve	I
the	I
Medicare	I
system	I

By	I
way	I

conclusion	I
,	O
it	I
is	I
true	I
that	I
the	I
development	I
of	I
the	I
health	I
care	I
system	I
helps	I
people	I
have	I
a	I
better	I
life	I
.	I
It	I
helps	I
people	I
build	I
a	I
sustainable	I
society	I
where	I
people	I
can	I
live	I
a	I
happy	I
life	I
when	I
they	I
are	I
old	I
.	I
Spending	I
time	I
with	I
a	I
large	I
number	I
of	I
friends	I
can	I
add	I
more	I
to	I
one	I
's	I
life	I
Despite	I
friendship	I
is	I
one	I
of	I
the	I
most	I
important	I
values	I
in	I
a	I
man	I
's	I
life	I
,	O
people	I
might	I
have	I
different	I
preferences	I
:	I
some	I
of	I
them	I
prefer	I
to	I
spend	I
time	I
with	I
one	I
or	I
two	I
close	I
friends	I
,	O
while	I
other	I
prefer	I
to	I
be	I
surrounded	I
by	I
a	I
large	I
number	I
of	I
friends	I
.	I
In	I
my	I
view	I
,	I
I	I
prefer	I
the	I
second	I
attitude	I
.	I
The	I
first	I
reason	I
is	I
that	I
staying	I
in	I
contact	I
with	I
a	I
large	I
number	I
of	I
friends	I
gives	I
the	I
opportunity	I
to	I
learn	I
more	I
from	I
the	I
others	I
'	I
experiences	I
.	I
For	I
instance	O
,	O
among	I
a	I
large	I
number	I
of	I
people	I
there	I
could	I
be	I
someone	I
who	I
practices	I
a	I
particular	I
sport	I
,	O
or	I
plays	I
an	I
instrument	I
or	I
likes	I
traveling	I
very	I
much	I
and	I
from	I
their	I
experiences	I
you	I
can	I
be	I
attracted	I
to	I
try	I
something	I
new	I
that	I
you	I
had	I
never	I
considered	I
before	I
.	I
Of	I
course	I
,	O
while	I
differences	I
give	I
the	I
opportunity	I
to	I
learn	I
,	O
they	I
can	I
also	I
mean	I
that	I
sometimes	I
it	I
can	I
be	I
difficult	I
to	I
reach	I
an	I
agreement	I
.	I
This	I
would	I
not	I
happen	I
or	I
at	I
least	I
would	I
happen	I
rarely	I
if	I
one	I
decides	I
to	I
spend	I
time	I
with	I
one	I
or	I
two	I
close	I
friends	I
.	I
In	I
fact	I
,	O
in	I
this	I
case	I
it	I
is	I
more	I
likely	I
that	I
interests	I
and	I
preferences	I
are	I
the	I
same	I
.	I
Another	I
reason	I
is	I
that	I
a	I
large	I
number	I
of	I
friends	I
can	I
help	I
you	I
to	I
consider	I
all	I
the	I
possible	I
solutions	I
to	I
a	I
problem	I
and	I
to	I
make	I
you	I
more	I
open-minded	I
.	I
For	I
example	I
,	O
if	I
you	I
happen	I
to	I
face	I
a	I
problem	I
and	I
ask	I
them	I
for	I
advice	I
,	O
your	I
friends	I
you	I
will	I
see	I
that	I
issue	I
from	I
their	I
different	I
point	I
of	I
views	I
and	I
accordingly	I
they	I
will	I
help	I
you	I
to	I
consider	I
better	I
all	I
advantages	I
and	I
disadvantages	I
.	I
When	I
you	I
have	I
just	I
few	I
close	I
friends	I
,	O
on	I
one	I
hand	I
you	I
develop	I
a	I
more	I
intimate	I
relationship	I
with	I
them	I
and	I
you	I
feel	I
you	I
can	I
trust	I
them	I
more	I
,	O
but	I
on	I
the	I
other	I
hand	I
they	I
often	I
will	I
give	I
you	I
viewpoints	I
not	I
so	I
different	I
from	I
yours	I
,	O
adding	I
less	I
to	I
your	I
experience	I
.	I
In	I
sum	I
,	O
although	I
each	I
choice	I
-	I
few	I
close	I
friends	I
or	I
a	I
large	I
number	I
of	I
friends	I
-	I
presents	I
its	I
advantages	I
and	I
its	I
weak	I
points	I
,	O
I	I
think	I
that	I
spending	I
time	I
with	I
a	I
large	I
number	I
of	I
friends	I
can	I
add	I
more	I
to	I
one	I
's	I
life	I
.	I
International	I
tourism	I
is	I
now	I
more	I
common	I
than	I
ever	I
before	I
The	I
last	I
50	I
years	I
have	I
seen	I
a	I
significant	I
increase	I
in	I
the	I
number	I
of	I
tourist	I
traveling	I
worldwide	I
.	I
While	O
some	I
might	I
think	I
the	I
tourism	I
bring	I
large	I
profit	I
for	I
the	I
destination	I
countries	I
,	O
I	I
would	I
contend	I
that	I
this	I
industry	I
has	I
affected	I
the	I
cultural	I
attributes	I
and	I
damaged	I
the	I
natural	I
environment	I
of	I
the	I
tourist	I
destinations	I
.	I
Firstly	I
,	O
it	I
is	I
an	I
undeniable	I
fact	I
that	I
tourists	I
from	I
different	I
cultures	I
will	I
probably	I
cause	I
changes	I
to	I
the	I
cultural	I
identity	I
of	I
the	I
tourist	I
destinations	I
.	I
Take	I
Thailand	I
for	I
example	I
,	I
in	I
the	I
Vietnam	I
War	I
,	I
many	I
American	I
soldiers	I
came	I
to	I
Thailand	I
for	I
a	I
break	I
and	I
involved	I
in	I
sexual	I
and	I
drug	I
activities	I
,	I
these	I
huge	I
demands	I
caused	I
many	I
local	I
businesses	I
opened	I
and	I
expanded	I
,	I
even	I
illegally	I
involved	I
in	I
under-age	I
prostitutes	I
to	I
maximize	I
their	I
profits	I
.	I
This	I
was	I
due	I
to	I
the	I
lack	I
of	I
adequate	I
controls	I
by	I
authorities	I
and	I
lead	I
to	I
a	I
bad	I
image	I
of	I
Thailand	I
tourism	I
.	I
Therefore	I
this	I
proves	I
that	I
international	I
tourism	I
can	I
create	I
negative	I
impacts	I
on	I
the	I
destination	I
countries	I
.	I
Secondly	I
,	O
there	I
are	I
clear	I
evidences	I
that	I
tourism	I
increasingly	I
create	I
harms	I
to	I
the	I
natural	I
habitats	I
of	I
the	I
destination	I
appeals	I
.	I
As	I
the	I
Australia	I
's	I
Great	I
Barrier	I
Reef	I
has	I
shown	I
,	I
the	I
billion	I
visitors	I
per	I
annum	I
has	I
generated	I
immense	I
destruction	I
to	I
this	I
nature	I
wonder	I
,	I
namely	I
breaking	I
the	I
corals	I
caused	I
by	I
walking	I
or	I
throwing	I
boat	I
's	I
anchors	I
,	I
dropping	I
fuel	I
and	I
other	I
sorts	I
of	I
pollutions	I
.	I
For	I
this	I
reason	I
,	O
many	I
marine	I
lives	I
have	I
been	I
endangered	I
,	O
in	I
the	I
extremes	I
part	I
of	I
the	I
reef	I
become	I
uninhabitable	I
for	I
these	I
marine	I
species	I
.	I
Thus	I
,	O
it	I
is	I
apparent	I
that	I
tourism	I
has	I
threatened	I
the	I
nature	I
environments	I
.	I
To	I
conclude	I
,	O
I	I
strongly	I
believe	I
that	I
the	I
tourism	I
has	I
created	I
threatening	I
pressure	I
on	I
both	I
the	I
sociocultural	I
and	I
natural	I
environments	I
.	I
If	I
authorities	I
do	I
not	I
take	I
steps	I
to	I
appropriately	I
conserve	I
these	I
precious	I
values	I
,	I
they	I
will	I
be	I
destroyed	I
in	I
the	I
near	I
future	I
.	I
International	O
tourism	O
leads	I
to	I
both	I
-	I
tension	I
and	I
understanding	I
I	I
agree	I
with	I
both	I
opinions	I
that	I
international	I
tourism	O
not	I
only	I
causes	I
tension	I
but	I
also	I
leads	I
to	I
understanding	I
between	I
people	I
from	I
different	I
culture	I
,	I
because	I
most	I
people	I
will	I
be	I
trying	I
to	I
understand	I
each	I
other	I
after	I
they	I
have	I
conflict	I
or	I
debates	I
.	I
There	I
is	I
no	I
doubt	I
that	I
some	I
behaviors	I
of	I
the	I
tourists	I
are	I
not	I
welcome	I
in	I
the	I
local	I
area	I
.	I
Firstly	I
,	O
some	I
people	I
leave	I
the	I
rubbish	I
after	I
visiting	I
the	I
attractions	I
.	I
Therefore	I
,	O
those	I
local	I
residents	I
have	I
to	I
clean	I
the	I
place	I
frequently	I
so	I
that	I
the	I
new	I
batch	I
of	I
tourists	I
will	I
have	I
a	I
tidy	I
and	I
neat	I
environment	I
.	I
Moreover	I
,	O
tourists	I
may	I
offend	I
the	I
local	I
people	I
due	I
to	I
their	I
different	I
culture	I
background	I
.	I
For	I
example	I
,	I
Indians	I
do	I
n't	I
eat	I
beef	I
since	I
they	I
worship	I
cows	I
.	I
Thus	I
,	O
if	I
tourists	I
want	I
to	I
respect	I
the	I
tradition	I
,	O
they	I
will	I
not	I
order	I
any	I
beef	I
in	I
the	I
local	I
restaurant	I
.	I
On	I
the	I
other	I
hand	I
,	O
in	I
order	I
to	I
avoid	I
the	I
conflicts	I
between	I
foreigners	I
and	I
locals	I
,	O
people	I
are	I
trying	I
to	I
understand	I
different	I
culture	I
and	I
find	I
solutions	I
.	I
For	I
instance	I
,	O
tourists	I
are	I
given	I
the	I
brochures	I
about	I
the	I
local	I
traditions	I
and	I
customs	I
before	I
they	I
visit	I
the	I
place	I
.	I
Furthermore	I
,	O
the	I
tour	I
guide	I
are	I
willing	I
to	I
help	I
tourists	I
to	I
understand	I
the	I
culture	I
from	I
other	I
countries	I
.	I
Thus	I
,	O
the	I
possibility	I
of	I
the	I
conflicts	I
is	I
reduced	I
because	I
the	I
understanding	I
between	I
both	I
parties	I
.	I
Obviously	I
,	O
people	I
are	I
looking	I
for	I
the	I
solution	I
such	I
as	I
understanding	I
each	I
other	I
while	I
they	I
encounter	I
the	I
conflicts	I
caused	I
by	I
international	I
tourism	I
.	I
Hence	I
,	O
I	I
think	I
international	I
tourism	I
leads	I
to	I
both	I
tension	I
and	I
understanding	I
between	I
people	I
from	I
different	I
culture	I
.	I
Can	I
technology	I
alone	I
solve	I
the	I
world	I
's	I
environmental	I
problems	I
?	O
It	I
is	I
irrefutable	I
that	I
progress	I
in	I
technology	I
leads	I
to	I
environmental	I
problems	I
.	I
Some	O
individuals	I
are	I
of	I
the	I
opinion	I
that	I
if	I
people	I
live	I
a	I
simple	I
life	I
and	I
do	I
not	I
use	I
the	I
things	I
that	I
technology	I
has	I
brought	I
us	I
then	I
these	I
problems	I
can	I
be	I
solved	I
whereas	I
others	I
opine	I
that	I
only	I
technology	I
can	I
solve	I
these	I
problems	I
.	I
In	I
the	I
following	I
paragraphs	I
,	I
I	I
intend	I
to	I
discuss	I
both	I
viewpoints	I
.	I
Some	I
people	I
say	I
that	I
if	I
humans	I
stop	I
using	I
technology	I
and	I
lead	I
a	I
simple	I
way	I
of	I
life	I
then	I
only	I
we	I
can	I
save	I
the	I
environment	I
.	I
They	I
argue	I
that	I
it	I
is	I
the	I
luxuries	I
people	I
use	I
which	I
damages	I
the	I
environment	I
.	I
If	O
people	I
do	I
n't	I
use	I
air	I
conditioners	I
,	O
automobiles	I
and	I
other	I
such	I
things	I
that	I
technology	I
has	I
brought	I
us	I
,	O
then	I
naturally	I
there	I
would	I
be	I
less	I
pollution	I
and	I
natural	I
resources	I
like	I
fossil	I
fuels	I
would	I
be	I
saved	I
and	I
all	I
this	I
would	I
save	I
the	I
environment	I
.	I
On	I
the	I
other	I
hand	I
there	I
are	I
people	I
who	I
say	I
that	I
technology	I
alone	I
could	I
save	I
the	I
environment	I
.	I
They	I
opine	I
that	I
now	I
we	I
have	I
come	I
so	I
far	I
ahead	I
in	I
technology	I
that	I
there	I
is	I
no	I
going	I
back	I
.	I
We	I
can	I
not	I
ask	I
the	I
people	I
of	I
the	I
jet	I
age	I
to	I
go	I
back	I
to	I
the	I
age	I
of	I
the	I
bullock	I
cart	I
.	I
There	I
are	I
a	I
lot	I
of	I
advances	I
going	I
on	I
technology	I
which	I
are	I
helping	I
the	I
environment	I
a	I
lot	I
.	I
One	I
prime	I
example	I
is	I
finding	I
solutions	I
to	I
water	I
problems	I
in	I
developing	I
countries	I
such	I
as	I
Africa	I
.	I
By	I
pressurising	I
sea	I
water	I
to	I
produce	I
vapour	I
jets	I
and	I
filtering	I
them	I
through	I
carbon	I
nano	I
tubes	I
,	I
we	I
can	I
get	I
clean	I
drinking	I
water	I
from	I
sea	I
water	I
-	I
an	I
almost	I
inexhaustible	I
resource	I
.	I
Furthermore	I
,	O
Japan	I
is	I
working	I
to	I
build	I
a	I
working	I
space	I
solar	I
power	I
system	I
by	I
2030	I
.	I
By	I
drawing	I
on	I
the	I
colossal	I
energy	I
of	I
the	I
sun	I
,	I
it	I
could	I
meet	I
the	I
entire	I

's	I
electricity	I
requirements	I
indefinitely	I
without	I
nuclear	I
or	I
GHG	I
emissions	I
.	I
If	I
successful	I
,	I
the	I
impact	I
on	I
the	I
world	I
would	I
be	I
monumental	I
.	I
It	I
would	I
mean	I
energy	I
for	I
schools	I
,	I
hospitals	I
,	I
and	I
homes	I
.	I
It	I
would	I
mean	I
another	I
industrial	I
revolution	I
.	I
To	I
put	I
it	I
in	I
a	I
nutshell	I
,	O
I	I
pen	I
down	I
saying	I
that	I
,	O
technology	I
alone	I
can	I
solve	I
the	I
world	I
's	I
environmental	I
problems	I
.	I
We	I
are	I
finally	I
entering	I
an	I
era	I
where	I
engineering	I
and	I
technology	I
are	I
making	I
the	I
world	I
a	I
better	I
place	I
.	I
It	I
would	I
be	I
highly	I
unpractical	I
to	I
ask	I
people	I
to	I
adopt	I
a	I
simpler	I
way	I
of	I
life	I
.	I
	O
The	I
city	I
which	I
I	I
enjoy	I
the	I
most	I
is	I
a	I
combination	I
of	I
history	I
and	I
modernity	I
The	I
city	I
where	I
I	I
was	I
born	I
used	I
to	I
be	I
of	I
a	I
great	I
antique	I
beauty	I
,	I
which	I
was	I
surrounded	I
with	I
by	I
lots	I
of	I
ancient	I
style	I
buildings	I
.	I
Unfortunately	I
,	O
the	I
unstoppable	I
trend	I
of	I
urbanization	I
makes	I
me	I
only	I
appreciate	I
parts	I
of	I
those	I
classic	I
buildings	I
in	I
the	I
pictures	I
or	I
in	I
museums	I
.	I
In	I
order	I
to	I
prevent	I
the	I
disappearance	I
of	I
the	I
historic	I
buildings	I
,	I
some	I
citizens	I
suggest	I
the	I
government	I
to	I
spend	I
money	I
on	I
historic	I
buildings	I
.	I
As	I
far	I
as	I
I	I
am	I
concerned	I
,	I
we	I
should	I
do	I
our	I
parts	I
to	I
do	I
what	I
ever	I
it	I
takes	I
to	I
protect	I
old	I
buildings	I
,	I
letting	I
next	I
generations	I
still	I
have	I
a	I
chance	I
to	I
look	I
at	I
them	I
.	I
Here	I
are	I
some	I
reasons	I
and	I
examples	I
to	I
illustrate	I
my	I
viewpoint	I
.	I
Historic	I
buildings	I
have	I
intrinsic	I
values	I
,	I
because	I
they	I
are	I
significant	I
symbols	I
of	I
a	I
city	I
.	I
Old	I
buildings	I
are	I
reminders	I
of	I
a	I
city	I
's	I
culture	I
and	I
complexity	I
.	I
By	I
seeing	I
historic	I
buildings	I
--	I
whether	I
related	I
to	I
something	I
famous	I
or	I
recognizably	I
dramatic	I
,	I
people	I
are	I
able	I
to	I
witness	I
the	I
aesthetic	I
and	I
cultural	I
history	I
of	I
an	I
area	I
.	I
For	I
example	I
,	O
when	I
somebody	I
mentions	I
Beijing	I
,	O
China	I
's	I
capital	I
city	I
,	O
you	I
will	I
immediately	I
have	I
Capital	I
Palace	I
come	I
to	I
appear	I
in	I
your	I
mind	I
,	O
because	I
it	I
is	I
the	I
most	I
remarkable	I
sign	I
of	I
the	I
city	I
,	O
and	I
also	I
it	I
is	I
the	I
inevitable	I
history	I
of	I
Beijing	I
,	O
even	I
the	I
entire	I
China	I
.	I
Depending	I
on	I
the	I
study	I
of	I
Capital	I
Palace	I
,	O
researchers	I
have	I
a	I
comprehensive	I
understanding	I
of	I
the	I
history	I
and	I
the	I
culture	I
.	I
Furthermore	I
,	O
historic	I
buildings	I
make	I
our	I
lives	I
more	I
colorful	I
,	O
provide	I
places	I
for	I
citizens	I
to	I
relax	I
bodies	I
and	I
minds	I
.	I
The	I
city	I
is	I
occupied	I
with	I
an	I
abundance	I
of	I
modern	I
houses	I
and	I
and	I
high	I
buildings	I
which	I
make	I
it	I
crowded	I
,	I
and	I
no	I
rooms	I
for	I
people	I
to	I
relax	I
themselves	I
.	I
However	I
,	I
the	I
warmth	I
of	I
the	I
materials	I
,	I
the	I
heart	I
pine	I
,	I
marble	I
,	I
or	I
the	I
old	I
brick	I
,	I
all	I
those	I
old	I
buildings	I
features	I
call	I
back	I
of	I
our	I
inner	I
peace	I
.	I
Lying	I
under	I
the	I
roof	I
of	I
a	I
historic	I
building	I
or	I
sitting	I
on	I
the	I
desk	I
fill	I
with	I
history	I
are	I
both	I
easy	I
ways	I
to	I
forget	I
life	I
's	I
little	I
annoyance	I
and	I
feel	I
peaceful	I
.	I
Meanwhile	I
,	O
historic	I
buildings	I
can	I
be	I
a	I
source	I
of	I
maintenance	I
fees	I
.	I
There	I
are	I
many	I
historic	I
buildings	I
,	O
such	I
as	I
Beijing	I
Place	I
,	O
Shanghai	I
Artist	I
Museum	I
,	O
they	I
are	I
all	I
able	I
to	I
support	I
themselves	I
financially	I
by	I
charging	I
tens	I
of	I
thousands	I
of	I
tourists	I
.	I
Our	I
governments	I
will	I
be	I
happy	I
with	I
those	I
efficient	I
consequences	I
,	I
and	I
a	I
majority	I
of	I
cities	I
also	I
can	I
imitate	I
this	I
economical	I
cycle	I
.	I
Overall	I
,	O
I	I
believe	I
that	I
the	I
city	I
which	I
I	I
enjoy	I
the	I
most	I
is	I
a	I
combination	I
of	I
history	I
and	I
modernity	I
.	I
However	I
,	O
the	I
preservation	I
of	I
old	I
buildings	I
is	I
a	I
one-way	I
street	I
.	I
There	I
is	I
no	I
chance	I
to	I
renovate	I
to	I
save	I
a	I
history	I
site	I
once	I
it	I
's	I
gone	I
.	I
This	I
reality	I
brings	I
us	I
to	I
light	I
the	I
importance	I
of	I
locating	I
and	I
saving	I
old	I
buildings	I
of	I
historic	I
significance	I
.	I
Therefore	I
,	O
government	I
should	I
spend	I
money	I
on	I
preservation	I
of	I
old	I
buildings	I
.	I
Some	I
people	I
believe	I
that	I
there	I
should	I
be	I
fixed	I
punishment	I
for	I
each	I
crime	I
type	I
Generally	I
reason	I
behind	I
punishment	I
is	I
to	I
reduce	I
the	I
crime	I
from	I
a	I
nation	I
and	I
to	I
build	I
a	I
fear	I
in	I
the	I
mind	I
of	I
offenders	I
.	I
Some	I
people	I
think	I
that	I
it	I
does	I
not	I
matter	I
what	I
is	I
reason	I
behind	I
committing	I
a	I
crime	I
therefore	I
there	I
should	I
be	I
fixed	I
punishment	I
for	I
a	I
specific	I
crime	I
.	I
Alternatively	I
I	I
believe	I
that	I
it	I
should	I
taken	I
into	I
consideration	I
the	I
situation	I
and	I
conditions	I
,	I
that	I
forces	I
to	I
a	I
person	I
to	I
be	I
a	I
criminal	I
.	I
First	I
of	I
all	I
if	I
there	I
will	I
be	I
a	I
fixed	I
punishment	I
for	I
each	I
type	I
of	I
crime	I
then	I
it	I
will	I
lead	I
to	I
increase	I
the	I
crime	I
because	I
the	I
punishment	I
will	I
be	I
clear	I
in	I
the	I
mind	I
of	I
professional	I
criminals	I
and	I
they	I
will	I
not	I
feel	I
fear	I
while	I
committing	I
a	I
crime	I
.	I
Secondly	I
,	O
laws	I
and	I
rules	I
are	I
there	I
for	I
people	I
therefore	I
it	I
is	I
necessary	I
to	I
have	I
a	I
look	I
behind	I
crime	I
for	I
instance	I
""""	I
a	I
women	I
steals	I
feed	I
for	I
her	I
child	I
should	I
be	I
treated	I
same	I
as	I
a	I
women	I
,	O
who	I
steals	I
for	I
her	I
drug	I
addiction	I
""""	I
.	I
The	I
person	I
who	I
committed	I
crime	I
first	I
time	I
and	I
the	I
professional	I
criminals	I
should	I
not	I
be	I
imprisoned	I
at	I
same	I
place	I
.	I
On	I
the	I
contrary	I
,	O
fixed	I
punishment	I
will	I
reduce	I
the	I
time	I
taken	I
by	I
judges	I
to	I
give	I
their	I
judgement	I
and	I
it	I
will	I
be	I
effective	I
economically	I
for	I
the	I
Government	I
.	I
Everyone	I
should	I
be	I
treated	I
equally	I
because	I
sometimes	I
we	I
see	I
that	I
a	I
poor	I
person	I
who	I
do	I
not	I
have	I
much	I
money	I
for	I
hiring	I
a	I
good	I
lawyer	I
they	I
get	I
imprisoned	I
even	I
without	I
committing	I
a	I
crime	I
and	I
when	I
they	I
come	I
back	I
to	I
the	I
society	I
they	I
become	I
a	I
professional	I
criminal	I
.	I
Therefore	I
fixed	I
punishment	I
will	I
reduce	I
the	I
space	I
between	I
poor	I
and	I
rich	I
people	I
and	I
everyone	I
will	I
understand	I
the	I
importance	I
of	I
each	I
other	I
.	I
To	I
conclude	I
,	O
Government	I
should	I
decide	I
for	I
punishment	I
case	I
by	I
case	I
basis	I
.	I
In	I
doing	I
so	I
crime	I
can	I
be	I
eliminated	I
from	I
a	I
nation	I
and	I
it	I
is	I
a	I
responsibility	I
of	I
every	I
individual	I
to	I
be	I
in	I
the	I
favor	I
of	I
truth	I
and	I
respect	I

in	I

the	I

To	I

Attending	I

I	I

a	I

Should	I

The	I
soaring	I

to	I
the	I
proposal	I
that	I
it	I
is	I
time	I
for	I
the	I

to	I
take	I
action	I
to	I
control	I
the	I
proliferation	I
of	I
violent	I
scenes	I
in	I

Obviously	I
,	O
violence	I
in	I
the	I
media	I
is	I
often	I
portrayed	I
as	I
extreme	I
as	I
possible	I
in	I
order	I
to	I
attract	I
audiences	I
.	I
This	O
will	I
definitely	I
set	I
a	I
bad	I
example	I
for	I
the	I
immature	I
audiences	I
who	I
,	O
lacking	I
correct	I
parental	I
guidance	I
and	I
abilities	I
to	I
differentiate	I
the	I
right	I
from	I
wrong	I
,	O
are	I
prone	I
to	I
go	I
astray	I
by	I
imitating	I
the	I
violent	I
behaviors	I
and	I
committing	I
real	I
violent	I
crimes	I
as	I
they	I
regard	I
the	I
violence	I
as	I
reasonable	I
and	I
justifiable	I
.	I
On	I
the	I
other	I
hand	I
,	O
media	I
,	O
such	I
as	I
TV	I
or	I

is	I
considered	I
as	I
the	I
correct	I
information	I
source	I
regulated	I
by	I
the	I
government	I
.	I
It	I
should	I
be	I
reporting	I
and	I
reflecting	I
true	I
phenomenon	I
in	I
the	I
society	I

Violence	I
,	O
as	I
one	I
of	I
the	I
facts	I
in	I
the	I
real	I
world	I
,	O
certainly	I
has	I
to	I
be	I
reported	I
.	I
However	I
,	O
excessive	I
violence	I
would	I
offer	I
misleading	I
information	I
to	I
the	I
public	I
and	I
exert	I
detrimental	I
influence	I
to	I
the	I
society	I
as	I
well	I
.	I
It	I
is	I
recently	I
reported	I
in	I
the	I
news	I
that	I
a	I
seventeen-year-old	I
boy	I
killed	I
all	I
his	I
family	I
members	I
,	I
one	I
sister	I
and	I
two	I
parents	I
out	I
of	I
hatred	I
and	I
jealousy	I
.	I
In	I
the	I
real	I
world	I
,	O
we	I
are	I
inclined	I
to	I
take	I
extreme	I
approach	I
to	I
tackle	I
a	I
small	I
problem	I
due	I
to	I
excessive	I
violence	I
exposure	I
.	I
We	I
can	I
not	I
deny	I
that	I
our	I
society	I
is	I
occupied	I
with	I
the	I
violent	I
scenes	I
and	I
plots	I
at	I
present	I
.	I
What	I
the	I
government	I
should	I
do	I
immediately	I
is	I
to	I
strengthen	I
censorship	I
to	I
control	I
the	I
amount	I
of	I
violence	I
in	I
media	I
.	I
Otherwise	I
,	O
the	I
violent	I
crime	I
rate	I
will	I
rise	I
continuously	I
and	I
out	I
of	I
control	I
someday	I
.	I
Life	I
in	I
a	I
city	I
is	I
much	I
better	I
than	I
life	I
in	I
the	I
countryside	I
As	I
far	I
as	I
I	I
am	I
concerned	I
,	I
I	I
agree	I
with	I
the	I
statement	I
that	I
life	I
in	I
a	I
city	I
is	I
much	I
better	I
than	I
life	I
in	I
the	I
countryside	I
.	I
Firstly	I
,	O
in	I
the	I
city	I
there	I
is	I
much	I
better	I
education	I
system	I
.	I
This	I
means	I
,	O
that	I
the	I
schools	I
and	I
the	I
universities	I
have	I
well	I
equipped	I
classes	I
and	I
the	I
famous	I
professors	I
would	I
like	I
to	I
work	I
in	I
such	I
places	I
.	I
In	I
addition	I
,	O
I	I
believe	I
that	I
city	I
provides	I
more	I
work	I
opportunities	I
than	I
the	I
countryside	I
.	I
There	I
are	I
not	I
only	I
more	I
jobs	I
,	I
but	I
they	I
are	I
also	I
well-paid	I
.	I
Of	I
course	I
living	I
in	I
a	I
city	I
is	I
more	I
expensive	I
,	I
but	I
incomes	I
are	I
higher	I
too	I
.	I
Moreover	I
,	O
in	I
the	I
urban	I
areas	I
there	I
are	I
also	I
more	I
citizens	I
what	I
means	I
,	O
that	I
the	I
culture	I
diversity	I
is	I
huge	I
.	I
Meeting	I
and	I
knowing	I
new	I
people	I
's	I
tradition	I
is	I
an	I
unforgettable	I
experience	I
,	I
which	I
could	I
influence	I
on	I
one	I
's	I
previous	I
habits	I
.	I
Furthermore	I
,	I
the	I
city	I
has	I
well-organised	I
lines	I
of	I
transport	I
.	I
The	I
buses	I
and	I
trains	I
are	I
more	I
frequent	I
than	I
in	I
the	I
countryside	I
,	I
so	I
the	I
city	I
provides	I
better	I
communication	I
.	I
However	I
,	O
in	I
the	I
countryside	I
there	I
are	I
many	I
places	I
to	I
rest	I
,	O
because	I
of	I
its	I
location	I
.	I
Moreover	I
,	O
peaceful	I
and	I
close	I
to	I
the	I
nature	I
areas	I
could	I
help	I
to	I
avoid	I
worries	I
and	I
sadness	I
.	I
Taking	I
all	I
into	I
account	I
,	O
I	I
think	I
that	I
living	I
in	I
the	I
city	I
is	I
much	I
better	I
nowadays	I
,	O
because	I
of	I
the	I
opportunities	I
it	I
gives	I
.	I
Today	I
living	I
in	I
the	I
rural	I
places	I
is	I
in	I
most	I
causes	I
connected	I
with	I
agrarian	I
lifestyle	I
,	I
which	I
for	I
me	I
is	I
without	I
perspective	I
.	I
If	I
I	I
could	I
decide	I
I	I
would	I
chose	I
living	I
in	I
the	I
city	I
for	I
sure	I
.	I
The	I
ability	I
to	I
relate	I
well	I
to	I
people	I
is	I
more	I
important	I
I	I
think	I
that	I
No	I
factor	I
is	I
important	I
enough	I
by	I
itself	I
to	I
succeed	I
in	I
any	I
situations	I
.	I
We	I
should	I
consider	I
many	I
factors	I
and	I
choose	I
the	I
best	I
of	I
them	I
.	I
I	I
believe	O
that	I
both	I
the	I
ability	I
to	I
relate	I
well	I
to	I
people	I
and	I
studying	I
hard	I
in	I
school	I
are	I
important	I
for	I
success	I
in	I
a	I
future	I
job	I
for	I
following	I
reasons	I
:	I
We	I
need	I
to	I
know	I
and	I
learn	I
about	I
the	I
theoritical	I
basis	I
of	I
our	I
future	I
job	I
.	I
This	I
can	I
be	I
done	I
in	I
school	I
.	I
In	I
school	I
,	O
we	I
are	I
able	I
to	I
identify	I
skills	I
required	I
for	I
our	I
future	I
job	I
and	I
work	I
on	I
mastering	I
and	I
learning	I
them	I
.	I
If	I
we	I
study	I
them	I
hard	I
,	O
we	I
will	I
have	I
the	I
chance	I
of	I
doing	I
our	I
job	I
better	I
and	I
quicker	I
in	I
the	I
future	I
.	I
For	I
example	I
,	O
if	I
someone	I
wants	I
to	I
become	I
a	I
good	I
industrial	I
engineer	I
,	O
he	I
should	I
study	I
his	I
technical	I
courses	I
very	I
well	I
so	I
that	I
he	I
will	I
be	I
able	I
to	I
utilize	I
them	I
well	I
in	I
his	I
future	I
job	I
.	I
As	I
you	I
can	I
see	I
,	O
studying	I
hard	I
in	I
school	I
is	I
an	I
important	I
factor	I
to	I
succeed	I
in	I
a	I
job	I
.	I
One	I
of	I
the	I
other	I
factors	I
for	I
success	I
in	I
a	I
future	I
job	I
is	I
effective	I
commuincation	I
.	I
By	I
relating	I
well	I
to	I
people	I
,	O
we	I
are	I
likely	I
to	I
have	I
a	I
lot	I
of	I
friends	I
and	I
therefore	I
we	I
will	I
have	I
a	I
wide	I
network	I
of	I
communication	I
.	I
Commuincation	I
can	I
bring	I
many	I
benefits	I
.	I
For	I
example	I
,	O
if	I
you	I
need	I
help	I
with	I
getting	I
a	I
job	I
,	O
by	I
commuincating	I
with	I
people	I
offering	I
jobs	I
whom	I
you	I
treat	I
well	I
and	I
therefore	I
they	I
respect	I
you	I
as	I
well	I
,	O
you	I
can	I
achieve	I
your	I
goal	I
.	I
Or	I
,	O
if	I
you	I
are	I
a	I
salesman	I
in	I
a	I
store	I
or	I
any	I
other	I
place	I
,	O
by	I
relating	I
well	I
to	I
your	I
customers	I
,	O
you	I
will	I
increase	I
the	I
chance	I
of	I
their	I
coming	I
back	I
again	I
and	I
becoming	I
your	I
regular	I
customers	I
.	I
So	I
,	O
relating	I
well	I
to	I
people	I
is	I
also	I
another	I
important	I
factor	I
.	I
In	I
sum	O
,	O
though	I
some	I
people	I
may	I
disagree	I
with	I
me	I
,	O
as	I
I	I
explained	I
my	I
reasons	I
and	I
examples	I
above	I
,	O
none	I
of	I
those	I
factors	I
are	I
important	I
and	I
sufficient	I
enough	I
by	I
themselves	I
and	I
we	I
should	I
notice	I
to	I
both	I
of	I
them	I
because	I
each	I
of	I
them	I
has	I
its	I
own	I
benefits	I
.	I
Studies	I
abroad	I
and	I
the	I
cultural	I
aspect	I
of	I
the	I
experience	I
Studying	I
abroad	I
is	I
one	I
very	I
common	I
thing	I
that	I
students	I
do	I
,	I
and	I
they	I
have	I
different	I
reasons	I
for	I
that	I
.	I
I	I
believe	I
that	I
studying	I
abroad	I
has	I
many	I
advantages	I
.	I
Students	I
gain	I
a	I
lot	I
out	I
of	I
the	I
experience	I
personally	I
,	O
academically	I
,	O
and	I
culturally	I
.	I
First	I
of	I
all	I
,	O
students	I
who	I
study	I
outside	I
their	I
countries	I
can	I
get	I
a	I
lot	I
of	I
experience	I
living	I
in	I
a	I
foreign	I
country	I
.	I
Living	I
in	I
a	I
new	I
country	I
requires	I
a	I
great	I
amount	I
of	I
flexibility	I
and	I
adaptability	I
in	I
one	I
's	I
character	I
.	I
For	I
example	I
,	O
students	I
might	I
face	I
many	I
challenges	I
in	I
the	I
host	I
country	I
.	I
Therefore	I
,	O
they	I
should	I
be	I
able	I
to	I
deal	I
with	I
the	I
obstacles	I
that	I
they	I
may	I
encounter	I
.	I
Overcoming	I
problems	I
teaches	I
the	I
students	I
how	I
to	I
be	I
more	I
mature	I
and	I
self-independence	I
.	I
One	I
other	I
important	I
factor	I
is	I
the	I
new	I
academic	I
experience	I
that	I
the	I
students	I
can	I
obtain	I
at	I
the	I
institution	I
where	I
they	I
are	I
pursuing	I
their	I
studies	I
.	I
For	I
example	I
,	O
they	I
will	I
get	I
exposed	I
to	I
a	I
different	I
educational	I
system	I
.	I
They	I
will	I
meet	I
new	I
professors	I
and	I
new	I
classmates	I
which	I
makes	I
the	I
academic	I
experience	I
different	I
from	I
that	I
in	I
their	I
home	I
country	I
.	I
Most	I
important	I
is	I
the	I
cultural	I
aspect	I
of	I
the	I
experience	I
.	I
While	I
living	I
in	I
a	I
foreign	I
country	I
,	I
students	I
can	I
learn	I
a	I
lot	I
about	I
the	I
culture	I
of	I
that	I
country	I
.	I
Furthermore	I
,	I
they	I
can	I
meet	I
different	I
people	I
of	I
the	I
country	I
.	I
They	I
can	I
learn	I
about	I
their	I
way	I
of	I
thinking	I
,	I
their	I
customs	I
and	I
traditions	I
,	I
and	I
way	I
of	I
life	I
.	I
Learning	I
about	I
others	I
'	I
cultures	I
is	I
so	I
important	I
.	I
It	I
contributes	I
in	I
building	I
a	I
new	I
understanding	I
in	I
us	I
of	I
how	I
we	I
see	I
the	I
world	I
.	I
It	I
makes	I
us	I
more	I
open	I
,	O
and	I
willing	I
to	I
accept	I
different	I
ideas	I
and	I
thoughts	I
.	I
Also	I
it	I
educates	I
us	I
about	I
the	I
world	I
we	I
are	I
living	I
in	I
.	I
In	I
conclusion	I
,	O
studying	I
abroad	I
does	I
not	I
only	I
have	I
advantages	I
,	O
but	I
also	I
can	I
change	I
us	I
in	I
a	I
very	I
positive	I
way	I
.	I
It	I
can	I
influence	I
us	I
in	I
different	I
aspects	I
of	I
life	I
.	I
It	I
is	I
better	I
for	I
children	I
to	I
grow	I
up	I
in	I
the	I
countryside	I
than	I
in	I
a	I
big	I
city	I
?	O
Nowadays	I
living	I
is	I
possible	I
on	I
every	I
place	I
of	I
the	I
world	I
,	I
but	I
still	I
there	I
are	I
some	I
differences	I
among	I
them	I
.	I
From	I
my	I
point	I
of	I
view	I
big	I
cities	I
can	I
be	I
a	I
good	I
place	I
for	I
bringing	I
up	I
children	I
.	I
To	I
begin	I
with	I
,	O
it	I
is	I
undeniable	I
that	I
education	I
is	I
better	I
in	I
big	I
cities	I
in	I
comparison	I
with	I
countrysides	I
.	I
For	I
instance	I
,	O
in	I
my	I
country	I
the	I
best	I
schools	I
,	O
universities	I
and	I
institutes	I
are	I
located	I
in	I
cities	I
,	O
and	I
todays	I
education	I
is	I
one	I
of	I
the	I
most	I
important	I
parts	I
of	I
our	I
children	I
's	I
life	I
.	I
Therefore	I
,	O
it	I
is	I
a	I
good	I
idea	I
for	I
children	I
to	I
past	I
their	I
first	I
earlier	I
life	I
in	I
the	I
cities	I

What	I
is	I
more	I

acknowledged	I
that	I
a	I
large	I
number	I
of	I
creational	I
facilities	I
are	I
built	I
in	I
cities	I

Children	I
who	I
live	I
in	I
cities	I
have	I
a	I
lot	I
of	I
entertainment	I
.	I
For	I
example	I
playgrounds	I
,	I
parks	I
,	I
science	I
museums	I
,	I
cinemas	I
etc	I
.	I
However	I
,	I
in	I
countrysides	I
we	I
hardly	I
ever	I
see	I
creational	I
facilities	I

Children	I
who	I
live	I
in	I
countrysides	I
most	I
of	I
the	I
time	I
pass	I
their	I
free	I
time	I
in	I
farms	I

Finally	I
,	O
in	I
big	I
cities	I
children	I
access	I
to	I
media	I
easily	I
,	O
so	I
they	I
can	I
learn	I
a	I
lot	I
of	I
things	I
by	I
watching	I
television	I
and	I
surfing	I
through	I
the	I
net	I
.	I
Via	I
internet	I
they	I
can	I
have	I
connection	I
with	I
the	I
other	I
children	I
all	I
around	I
the	I
world	I
,	I
therefor	I
they	I
can	I
exchange	I
their	I
knowledge	I
,	I
they	I
can	I
learn	I
different	I
cultures	I
.	I
To	I
sum	I
up	I
,	O
although	I
countrysides	I
have	I
some	I
advantages	I
such	I
as	I
fresh	I
air	I
,	I
peace	I
,	I
and	I
etc	I

Today	I
's	I
children	I
needs	I
somethings	I
to	I
entertain	I
them	I
,	I
and	I
occupy	I
their	I
leisure	I
time	I
in	I
the	I
best	I
way	I
.	I
Should	I
we	I
require	I
our	I
young	I
children	I
to	I
learn	I
music	I
and	I
art	I
Every	I
parents	I
expect	I
their	I
children	I
to	I
be	I
outstanding	I
and	I
successful	I
.	I
In	I
order	I
to	I
achieve	I
this	I
,	O
they	I
start	I
cultivating	I
their	I
children	I
when	I
they	I
are	I
very	I
young	I
.	I
In	I
addition	I
to	I
basic	I
knowledge	I
like	I
language	I
or	I
science	I
,	I
music	I
and	I
art	I
are	I
usually	I
on	I
the	I
must-learn	I
list	I
of	I
the	I
parents	I
.	I
In	I
my	I
opinion	I
,	O
I	I
agree	I
that	I
children	I
should	I
learn	I
music	I
and	I
art	I
in	I
a	I
young	I
age	I
because	I
they	I
do	I
contribute	I
several	I
merits	I
to	I
them	I
.	I
First	I
,	O
it	I
's	I
very	I
suitable	I
for	I
children	I
to	I
develop	I
senses	I
of	I
music	I
and	I
art	I
when	I
they	I
are	I
young	I
.	I
Children	I
absorb	I
things	I
quickly	I
and	I
they	I
bear	I
exact	I
the	I
ability	I
needed	I
in	I
music	I
and	I
art-imagination	I
.	I
Music	I
and	I
art	I
are	I
not	I
like	I
math	I
or	I
language	I
which	I
has	I
more	I
strict	I
rules	I
.	I
They	I
are	I
more	I
abstract	I
,	I
requiring	I
creativity	I
and	I
imagination	I
to	I
be	I
enriched	I
.	I
Children	I
are	I
privileged	I
to	I
have	I
these	I
abilities	I
because	I
they	I
are	I
given	I
more	I
freedom	I
and	I
their	I
imagination	I
has	I
not	I
yet	I
been	I
killed	I
due	I
to	I
reality	I
circumstances	I
.	I
Even	I
if	I
their	I
performances	I
are	I
just	I
some	I
simple	I
drawings	I
and	I
melodies	I
,	I
music	I
and	I
art	I
still	I
bring	I
out	I
children	I
's	I
joy	I
of	I
flying	I
in	I
imagination	I
.	I
Second	I
,	O
music	I
and	I
art	I
are	I
life-long	I
cultivation	I
worthy	I
of	I
investing	I
.	I
They	I
teach	I
us	I
how	I
to	I
appreciate	I
beauty	I
and	I
express	I
feelings	I
in	I
a	I
creative	I
way	I
.	I
They	I
are	I
essential	I
to	I
our	I
spiritual	I
life	I
.	I
Therefore	I
,	O
even	I
if	I
children	I
are	I
not	I
going	I
to	I
be	I
great	I
musicians	I
or	I
artists	I
,	O
learning	I
music	I
and	I
art	I
is	I
still	I
worthy	I
because	I
it	I
can	I
nourish	I
your	I
temper	I
and	I
serve	I
as	I
a	I
leisure	I
.	I
However	I
,	O
some	I
people	I
might	I
argue	I
that	I
parents	I
should	I
n't	I
put	I
so	I
much	I
stress	I
on	I
children	I
,	O
since	I
learning	I
too	I
many	I
skills	I
seems	I
to	I
be	I
a	I
burden	I
for	I
them	I
.	I
In	I
my	I
opinion	I
,	O
it	I
depends	I
on	I
how	I
you	I
value	I
these	I
learning	I
activities	I
to	I
be	I
like	I
.	I
If	I
parents	I
push	I
their	I
5	I
years	I
old	I
child	I
to	I
play	I
piano	I
8	I
hours	I
a	I
day	I
just	I
like	I
a	I
professional	I
performer	I
,	I
that	I
might	I
be	I
too	I
much	I
.	I
In	I
a	I
child	I
stage	I
,	O
music	I
and	I
art	I
are	I
more	I
like	I
an	I
open	I
door	I
to	I
introduce	I
the	I
art	I
world	I
than	I
training	I
area	I
to	I
acquire	I
specific	I
skills	I
.	I
In	I
this	I
way	I
,	I
it	I
will	I
not	I
be	I
such	I
pressure	I
on	I
children	I
.	I
In	I
conclusion	I
,	O
young	I
age	I
is	I
the	I
perfect	I
time	I
for	I
children	I
to	I
learn	I
music	I
and	I
art	I
and	I
they	I
are	I
indeed	I
valuable	I
to	I
people	I
not	I
only	I
in	I
their	I
young	I
stage	I
,	I
but	I
in	I
every	I
stage	I
.	I
Music	I
and	I
art	I
can	I
accompany	I
a	I
spirit	I
as	I
long	I
as	I
they	I
are	I
given	I
the	I
chance	I
to	I
enter	I
his/her	I
life	I
.	I
The	I
car	I
use	I
will	I
definitely	I
decrease	I
in	I
twenty	I
years	I
Views	I
differ	I
considerably	I
when	I
it	I
comes	I
to	I
the	I
issue	I
of	I
whether	I
cars	I
will	I
be	I
less	I
than	I
there	I
are	I
today	I
in	I
twenty	I
years	I
or	I
not	I
.	I
Some	I
people	I
believe	I
that	I
since	I
the	I
environmental	I
concern	I
has	I
risen	I
,	I
the	I
car	I
use	I
will	I
decrease	I
.	I
While	I
others	I
think	I
that	I
a	I
personal	I
car	I
is	I
important	I
for	I
ones	I
daily	I
life	I
.	I
Both	I
of	I
the	I
opposite	I
arguments	I
appear	I
to	I
be	I
somewhat	I
convincing	I
and	I
stand	I
to	I
reason	I
.	I
But	I
as	I
far	I
as	I
I	I
am	I
concerned	I
,	O
I	I
agree	I
with	I
the	I
idea	I
,	O
which	I
is	I
that	I
there	I
will	I
be	I
a	I
decrease	I
in	I
cars	I
use	I
in	I
the	I
future	I
.	I
The	I
following	I
reasons	I
will	I
present	I
my	I
points	I
.	I
First	I
of	I
all	I
,	O
since	I
the	I
public	I
transportation	I
has	I
improved	I
,	O
it	I
is	I
much	I
convenience	I
to	I
take	I
a	I
subway	I
or	I
a	I
bus	I
.	I
For	I
example	I
,	O
I	I
live	I
in	I
a	I
city	I
which	I
always	I
have	I
a	I
jam	I
in	I
the	I
morning	I
and	I
does	I
n't	I
have	I
enough	I
parking	I
lots	I
for	I
the	I
cars	I
.	I
So	I
,	O
with	I
the	I
stations	I
increased	I
people	I
are	I
willing	I
to	I
take	I
a	I
public	I
transportation	I
than	I
drive	I
on	I
their	I
own	I
.	I
Second	I
,	O
a	I
driving	I
car	I
can	I
make	I
a	I
lot	I
of	I
different	I
pollutions	I
to	I
the	I
world	I
.	I
So	I
,	O
with	I
the	I
risen	I
of	I
the	I
aware	I
to	I
the	I
environment	I
,	O
people	I
will	I
think	I
more	I
about	I
whether	I
to	I
drive	I
on	I
their	I
own	I
or	I
not	I
.	I
For	I
example	I
,	O
instead	I
of	I
driving	I
each	I
one	I
's	I
car	I
,	O
if	I
we	I
put	I
forty	I
people	I
in	I
a	I
bus	I
,	O
it	I
will	I
solve	I
the	I
traffic	I
jam	I
by	I
decrease	I
the	I
cars	I
use	I
and	I
also	I
reduce	I
the	I
air	I
pollution	I
for	I
the	I
city	I
.	I
Although	I
,	O
I	I
am	I
agree	I
with	I
the	I
idea	I
that	I
reducing	I
of	I
the	I
car	I
use	I
will	I
be	I
achieve	I
in	I
twenty	I
years	I
.	I
I	I
think	I
I	I
still	I
have	I
to	I
point	I
out	I
that	I
there	I
are	I
some	I
different	I
points	I
of	I
view	I
.	I
People	I
who	I
hold	I
different	I
opinion	I
may	I
argue	I
that	I
a	I
personal	I
car	I
uses	I
is	I
in	I
need	I
because	I
a	I
public	I
transportation	I
ca	I
n't	I
meet	I
every	I
place	I
.	I
Of	I
course	I
,	O
it	I
may	I
be	I
true	I
when	I
you	I
want	I
to	I
go	I
to	I
some	I
countryside	I
or	I
some	I
other	I
inconvenience	I
places	I
.	I
However	I
,	O
no	I
matter	I
you	I
are	I
going	I
to	I
somewhere	I
for	I
a	I
trip	I
or	I
you	I
just	I
simply	I
live	I
in	I
some	I
suburbs	I
and	I
so	I
on	I
,	O
it	I
always	I
have	I
some	I
other	I
ways	I
that	I
you	I
can	I
do	I
,	O
you	I
can	I
ride	I
a	I
bike	I
,	O
or	I
even	I
walk	I
on	I
your	I
feet	I
.	I
It	I
not	I
only	I
helps	I
you	I
to	I
reduce	I
the	I
car	I
use	I
,	I
but	I
also	I
good	I
to	I
your	I
health	I
.	I
In	I
this	I
way	I
,	I
this	I
wo	I
n't	I
be	I
a	I
problem	I
at	I
all	I
.	I
In	I
conclusion	I
,	O
given	I
the	I
reasons	I
described	I
above	I
,	O
when	I
the	I
advantages	I
and	I
disadvantages	I
of	I
whether	I
there	I
will	I
be	I
fewer	I
cars	I
in	I
use	I
in	I
twenty	I
years	I
or	I
not	I
are	I
carefully	I
compared	I
,	O
the	I
best	I
choice	I
is	I
obviously	I
stand	I
on	I
my	I
side	I
,	O
which	I
is	I
that	I
the	I
car	I
use	I
will	I
definitely	I
decrease	I
in	I
twenty	I
years	I
.	I
Computers	I
replace	I
human	I
teachers	I
With	I
the	I
number	I
of	I
technological	I
advances	I
growing	I
apace	I
,	I
it	I
is	I
generally	I
believed	I
that	I
Internet	I
and	I
computers	I
will	I
supplant	I
the	I
traditional	I
role	I
of	I
teachers	I
in	I
a	I
not	I
too	I
distant	I
future	I
.	I
This	I
idea	I
may	I
point	I
out	I
to	I
two	I
main	I
directions	I
,	I
both	I
of	I
which	I
present	I
different	I
arguments	I
.	I
Central	I
to	I
the	I
supporting	I
arguments	I
of	I
this	I
issue	I
is	I
the	I
idea	I
that	I
the	I
global	I
online	I
network	I
is	I
the	I
inexhaustible	I
source	I
of	I
information	I
,	I
which	I
definitely	I
exceeds	I
the	I
fund	I
of	I
knowledge	I
that	I
any	I
veteran	I
teacher	I
can	I
accumulate	I
.	I
Internet	I
and	I
computer	I
also	I
offer	I
a	I
more	I
comprehensive	I
access	I
to	I
knowledge	I
,	I
ranging	I
from	I
visual	I
to	I
aural	I
stimuli	I
,	I
which	I
make	I
learning	I
an	I
ever	I
enjoyable	I
experience	I
,	O
especially	I
for	I
children	I
.	I
On	O
the	I
other	I
hand	I
,	O
critics	I
of	I
this	I
idea	I
maintain	I
that	I
although	I
the	I
educational	I
benefits	I
that	I
the	I
Internet	I
may	I
yield	I
are	I
undeniable	I
,	O
there	I
still	I
remain	I
certain	I
shortcomings	I
.	I
Much	I
information	I
as	I
the	I
Internet	I
may	I
provide	I
,	I
most	I
of	I
the	I
sources	I
are	I
unjustified	I
by	I
experts	I
.	I
As	I
a	I
result	I
,	O
information	I
from	I
those	I
sources	I
is	I
subject	I
to	I
question	I
.	I
Admittedly	I
,	O
the	I
computer	I
can	I
show	I
whether	I
an	I
answer	I
to	I
a	I
particular	I
question	I
is	I
right	I
or	I
wrong	I
but	I
it	I
can	I
not	I
give	I
as	I
an	I
in-depth	I
explanation	I
as	I
a	I
human	I
teacher	I
can	I
.	I
Through	O
face-to-face	I
communication	I
,	O
teachers	I
can	I
also	I
pinpoint	I
the	I
weaknesses	I
of	I
each	I
student	I
and	I
therefore	I
,	O
adjusting	I
and	I
tailoring	I
his	I
or	I
her	I
teaching	I
methodology	I
to	I
meet	I
the	I
levels	I
or	I
the	I
demands	I
of	I
those	I
students	I
.	I
This	I
is	I
where	I
the	I
computer	I
proves	I
to	I
be	I
incompetent	I
.	I
In	I
short	I
,	O
although	I
both	I
sides	I
have	I
their	I
equally	I
valid	I
arguments	I
,	O
I	I
am	I
inclined	I
to	I
think	I
that	I
although	I
Internet	I
can	I
be	I
a	I
useful	I
tool	I
for	I
education	I
,	O
at	I
no	I
time	I
will	I
the	I
unique	I
role	I
of	I
human	I
teachers	I
be	I
replaced	I
.	I
	O
Nowadays	I
,	O
spending	I
budget	I
on	I
space	I
exploration	I
is	I
not	I
reasonable	I
Space	I
exploration	I
,	O
for	I
discovery	I
of	I
out	I

has	I
been	I
possible	I
for	I
human	I
in	I
the	I
20th	I
century	I

The	I
United	I
state	I

Russia	I
are	I
the	I
important	I
countries	I
that	I
spend	I
large	I
budgets	I
for	I
the	I
research	I
of	I
this	I
subject	I
.	I
In	I
my	I
opinion	I
,	O
spending	I
the	I
budget	I
for	I
space	I
exploration	I
is	I
an	I
important	I
activity	I
to	I
save	I
living	I
of	I
humanity	I
in	I
the	I
future	I
.	I
Many	I
governments	I
believe	I
that	I
space	I
exploration	I
is	I
an	I
activity	I
that	I
wastes	I
the	I
budget	I
,	I
while	I
the	I
essential	I
challenge	I
of	I
humanity	I
in	I
the	I
future	I
would	I
be	I
the	I
discovery	I
of	I
a	I
new	I
place	I
for	I
the	I
living	I
.	I
In	I
20th	I
century	I
,	O
although	I
human	I
being	I
succeeded	I
to	I
achieve	I
out	I
of	I
space	I
by	I
means	I
of	I
new	I
technologies	I
such	I
as	I
rockets	I
,	O
but	I
finding	I
a	I
new	I
place	I
for	I
living	I
in	I
another	I
planet	I
is	I
impossible	I
until	I
now	I

In	I
during	I
history	I
,	O
our	I
planet	I
is	I
threatening	I
by	I
many	I
of	I
other	I

stars	I
and	I
it	I
is	I
an	I
enormous	I
danger	I
for	I

of	I

Therefore	I
,	O
it	I
is	I
very	I
significant	I
to	I
find	I
a	I
new	I
place	I
for	I

In	I

Distance	I
learning	I

online	I

classroom	I
During	I
these	I
digital	I
age	I
,	I
the	I
online	I
classes	I
has	I
become	I
more	I
interest	I
and	I
more	I
common	I
in	I
the	I
society	I
.	I
Almost	I
every	I
school	I
develops	I
their	I
online	I
class	I
systems	I
.	I
One	I
question	I
I	I
always	I
thought	I
about	I
is	I
whether	I
online	I
computer	I
classes	I
should	I
replace	I
classroom	I
learning	I
.	I
Although	I
,	O
online	I
classes	I
have	I
many	I
advantages	I
,	O
for	I
me	I
,	O
I	I
prefer	I
traditional	I
learning	I
classes	I
for	I
several	I
reasons	I
.	I
First	I
,	O
the	I
participant	I
with	I
the	I
others	I
like	I
classmates	I
or	I
professors	I
is	I
still	I
an	I
important	I
factor	I
in	I
studying	I
.	I
Working	I
in	I
group	I
leads	I
to	I
more	I
discussion	I
and	I
more	I
opinion	I
among	I
the	I
class	I
.	I
Consequently	I
,	O
the	I
discussion	I
class	I
results	I
in	I
expanded	I
children	I
vision	I
and	I
their	I
respect	I
to	I
others	I
roommate	I
's	I
ideas	I
.	I
Unlike	I
the	I
distance	I
learning	I
that	I
children	I
have	I
few	I
opportunities	I
to	I
discuss	I
with	I
their	I
friends	I
.	I
Second	I
,	O
classroom	I
learning	I
provides	I
other	I
activities	I
than	I
studying	I
.	I
During	I
student	I
's	I
free	I
time	I
,	O
they	I
have	I
a	I
number	I
of	I
activities	I
that	I
they	I
can	I
join	I
,	O
such	I
as	I
playing	I
sports	I
,	O
going	I
to	I
lab	I
,	I
or	I
going	I
to	I
library	I
.	I
These	I
activities	I
lead	I
to	I
more	I
interact	I
with	I
their	I
friends	I
.	I
Connection	I
with	I
friends	I
improves	I
their	I
IQ	I
abilities	I
,	I
furthermore	I
,	I
they	I
have	I
a	I
chance	I
to	I
learn	I
about	I
their	I
societies	I
.	I
While	I
the	I
online	I
course	I
keeps	I
the	I
children	I
at	I
their	I
home	I
only	I
.	I
Lastly	I
,	O
in	I
school	I
,	O
there	I
are	I
professors	I
that	I
guided	I
you	I
during	I
you	I
had	I
a	I
problem	I
or	I
needed	I
an	I
advice	I
.	I
The	I
professor	I
provides	I
good	I
answers	I
to	I
you	I
.	I
They	I
do	I
not	I
mind	I
helping	I
you	I
,	I
and	I
they	I
never	I
leave	I
you	I
alone	I
when	I
you	I
got	I
a	I
problem	I
.	I
In	I
contrast	I
,	O
in	I
distance	I
learning	I
,	O
these	I
aspects	I
of	I
the	I
professor	I
had	I
reduced	I
their	I
important	I
.	I
The	I
professor	I
has	I
been	I
assigned	I
to	I
teach	I
only	I
.	I
Moreover	I
,	O
there	I
will	I
be	I
a	I
long	I
response	I
from	I
the	I
teachers	I
when	I
children	I
ask	I
them	I
a	I
question	I
.	I
In	I
conclusion	I
,	O
traditional	I
learning	I
still	I
has	I
many	I
benefits	I
to	I
the	I
students	I
.	I
But	I
in	I
the	I
future	I
,	O
it	I
seems	I
that	I
the	I
distance	I
learning	I
become	I
more	I
popular	I
and	I
ordinary	I
in	I
schools	I
.	I
Should	I
all	I
the	I
advertisements	I
be	I
banned	I
?	O
Never	I
in	I
history	I
was	I
advertising	I
industry	I
so	I
developed	I
as	I
in	I
modern	I
society	I
and	I
it	I
has	I
led	I
to	I
some	I
adverse	I
sentiments	I
in	I
public	I
because	I
some	I
deliver	I
exaggerated	I
and	I
fake	I
information	I
.	I
Hence	I
whether	I
we	I
should	I
ban	I
all	I
the	I
advertisements	I
or	I
not	I
has	I
aroused	I
much	I
controversy	I
of	I
the	I
public	I
.	I
My	I
view	I
is	I
that	I
while	I
some	I
of	I
them	I
are	I
disturbing	I
,	I
we	I
can	I
not	I
overlook	I
other	I
merits	I
the	I
advertisements	I
bring	I
.	I
First	I
,	O
it	I
is	I
unfair	I
to	I
restrict	I
those	I
public	I
service	I
advertisements	I
which	I
are	I
creative	I
and	I
inspiring	I
.	I
In	I
fact	I
,	O
they	I
are	I
not	I
in	I
the	I
purpose	I
of	I
making	I
profits	I
but	I
taking	I
a	I
role	I
of	I
disseminating	I
valued	I
culture	I
,	O
good	I
moral	I
traits	I
and	I
calling	I
for	I
helps	I
for	I
the	I
disabled	I
and	I
the	I
poor	I
.	I
Besides	I
,	O
it	I
is	I
obvious	I
that	I
publicizing	I
brand	I
image	I
or	I
a	I
particular	I
product	I
of	I
mass	I
media	I
could	I
boost	I
sales	I
for	I
companies	I
.	I
In	I
a	I
larger	I
sense	I
,	O
it	I
could	I
simulate	I
household	I
spending	I
and	I
therefore	I
promote	I
the	I
economic	I
development	I
of	I
the	I
whole	I
country	I
.	I
A	I
recent	I
study	I
shows	I
that	I
after	I
launching	I
an	I
advertising	I
campaign	I
,	I
the	I
sales	I
revenue	I
would	I
increase	I
by	I
40	I
%	I
,	I
which	I
is	I
the	I
very	I
fact	I
to	I
verify	I
its	I
positive	I
influences	I
on	I
economic	I
.	I
That	I
is	I
not	I
to	I
say	I
,	I
however	I
,	O
that	I
advertisements	I
have	I
no	I
downsides	I
.	I
Of	I
course	I
,	O
the	I
advertising	I
expenses	I
lead	I
to	I
a	I
higher	I
product	I
price	I
and	I
some	I
of	I
them	I
express	I
fake	I
information	I
,	O
creating	I
information	I
asymmetry	I
between	I
consumers	I
and	I
companies	I
.	I
Yet	I
,	I
its	I
merits	I
still	I
outweigh	I
these	I
downsides	I
.	I
Taken	I
all	I
together	I
,	O
advertisements	I
have	I
its	I
social	I
responsibility	I
and	I
contribute	I
to	I
economic	I
growth	I
.	I
We	I
can	I
not	I
deny	I
all	I
of	I
them	I
.	I
However	I
,	O
if	I
those	I
with	I
exaggerated	I
and	I
fake	I
information	I
could	I
be	I
banned	I
,	O
advertisements	I
would	I
be	I
welcomed	I
by	I
more	I
.	I
	O
Students	I
should	I
be	I
required	I
to	I
take	I
regular	I
standardized	I
tests	I
The	I
issue	I
at	I
hand	I
is	I
if	I
the	I
schools	I
should	I
require	I
students	I
to	I
take	I
regular	I
standardized	I
exams	I
.	I
This	I
issue	I
is	I
important	I
because	I
nowadays	I
many	I
people	I
cast	I
doubt	I
on	I
it	I
.	I
However	I
,	O
I	I
believe	I
that	I
standardized	I
tests	I
are	I
valuable	I
option	I
for	I
educational	I
system	I
as	I
long	I
as	I
it	I
would	I
help	I
teachers	I
to	I
know	I
if	I
the	I
students	I
are	I
really	I
getting	I
knowledge	I
.	I
Firstly	I
,	O
standardized	I
tests	I
are	I
preferable	I
due	I
to	I
the	I
fact	I
that	I
they	I
help	I
teachers	I
to	I
fairly	I
grade	I
the	I
students	I
.	I
For	I
example	I
some	I
students	I
are	I
not	I
so	I
active	I
on	I
the	I
lessons	I
,	I
cause	I
they	I
are	I
already	I
familiar	I
with	I
the	I
issue	I
.	I
Therefore	I
,	O
exams	I
could	I
be	I
the	I
only	I
way	I
for	I
teachers	I
to	I
see	I
the	I
real	I
abilities	I
of	I
those	I
students	I
.	I
In	I
addition	I
,	O
many	I
teachers	I
rely	I
only	I
on	I
the	I
exam	I
results	I
while	I
grading	I
the	I
class	I
,	O
so	I
the	I
usage	I
of	I
standardized	I
tests	I
is	I
the	I
superior	I
option	I
for	I
them	I
.	I
Additionally	I
,	O
standardized	I
tests	I
can	I
be	I
good	I
chance	I
for	I
students	I
to	I
apply	I
their	I
knowledge	I
on	I
practice	I
.	I
Since	I
,	O
some	I
students	I
may	I
get	I
used	I
to	I
simply	I
rewriting	I
solved	I
problems	I
from	I
the	I
blackboard	I
,	O
so	I
they	I
will	I
never	I
try	I
to	I
solve	I
problems	I
on	I
their	I
own	I
.	I
However	I
,	O
standardized	I
tests	I
offer	I
them	I
such	I
chance	I
.	I
Thus	I
,	O
it	I
is	I
clear	I
that	I
schools	I
should	I
require	I
students	I
to	I
take	I
standardized	I
tests	I
,	O
as	I
long	I
as	I
this	I
option	I
helps	I
to	I
both	I
sides	I
.	I
Finally	I
,	O
I	I
think	I
that	I
requirement	I
to	I
take	I
standardized	I
tests	I
is	I
the	I
right	I
choice	I
,	O
since	I
in	I
this	I
case	I
teachers	I
can	I
compare	I
the	I
level	I
of	I
knowledge	I
of	I
different	I
students	I
.	I
In	I
any	I
class	I
there	I
will	I
be	I
students	I
who	I
will	I
show	I
low	I
academic	I
performance	I
,	I
so	I
teachers	I
could	I
work	I
with	I
them	I
more	I
intensively	I
.	I
I	I
support	I
the	I
points	I
of	I
those	I
who	I
say	I
that	I
standardized	I
tests	I
are	I
required	I
over	I
those	I
who	I
do	I
n't	I
because	I
if	I
the	I
teacher	I
would	I
know	I
the	I
level	I
of	I
each	I
student	I
he	I
would	I
fairly	I
share	I
his	I
time	I
to	I
all	I
of	I
them	I
.	I
Ultimately	I
I	I
feel	I
that	I
schools	I
which	I
obligate	I
their	I
students	I
to	I
take	I
standardized	I
tests	I
are	I
right	I
.	I
I	I
belive	I
this	I
,	O
due	I
to	I
the	I
fact	I
that	I
these	I
schools	I
can	I
qualitatively	I
check	I
if	I
they	I
are	I
giving	I
an	I
appropriate	I
education	I
to	I
their	I
students	I
.	I
Communicating	I
via	I
e-mail	I
and	I
voice	I
mail	I
vs	I
Telephone	I
and	I
face-to	I
face	I
Although	I
many	I
people	I
prefer	I
communicating	I
by	I
telephone	I
or	I
face-to-face	I
,	I
personally	I
I	I
believe	I
that	I
communicating	I
by	I
e-mails	I
or	I
voice	I
mails	I
is	I
better	I
.	I
There	I
are	I
several	I
reasons	I
to	I
support	I
this	I
idea	I
which	I
I	I
would	I
like	I
to	I
mention	I
in	I
this	I
essay	I
.	I
Firstly	I
,	I
communicating	I
by	I
e-mail	I
is	I
easy	I
.	I
Many	I
people	I
have	I
problems	I
with	I
calling	I
a	I
person	I
that	I
they	I
are	I
not	I
acquainted	I
with	I
.	I
In	I
this	I
case	I
it	I
is	I
not	I
so	I
difficult	I
to	I
write	I
an	I
e-mail	I
or	I
to	I
leave	I
a	I
voice	I
mail	I
because	I
even	I
shy	I
people	I
feel	I
themselves	I
more	I
confident	I
.	I
Secondly	I
,	I
you	I
can	I
write	I
an	I
e-mail	I
at	I
any	I
time	I
of	I
the	I
day	I
.	I
As	I
for	I
me	I
,	O
I	I
work	I
and	I
study	I
at	I
the	I
university	I
and	I
I	I
do	I
n't	I
have	I
spare	I
time	I
during	I
the	I
day	I
.	I
I	I
get	I
home	I
at	I
about	I
midnight	I
and	I
I	I
still	I
need	I
to	I
answer	I
some	I
questions	I
and	I
to	I
solve	I
some	I
routine	I
problems	I
.	I
I	I
might	I
not	I
have	I
time	I
to	I
call	I
a	I
person	I
or	I
to	I
meet	I
with	I
him	I
or	I
her	I
in	I
an	I
appropriate	I
time	I
so	I
for	I
me	I
it	I
is	I
better	I
to	I
leave	I
a	I
voice	I
mail	I
.	I
Thirdly	I
,	O
when	I
you	I
write	I
an	I
e-mail	I
you	I
have	I
enough	I
time	I
to	I
think	I
carefully	I
about	I
what	I
you	I
are	I
writing	I
and	I
how	I
it	I
would	I
be	I
better	I
to	I
express	I
yourself	I
.	I
For	I
example	I
,	O
you	I
can	I
change	I
the	I
word	I
order	I
or	I
you	I
can	I
choose	I
more	I
appropriate	I
style	I
to	I
sound	I
more	I
polite	I
.	I
When	I
you	I
speak	I
face-to-face	I
you	I
are	I
not	I
as	I
able	I
to	I
control	I
every	I
word	I
as	I
you	I
are	I
when	I
you	I
write	I
an	I
e-mail	I
.	I
And	I
finally	I
,	O
there	I
is	I
no	I
chance	I
to	I
disturb	I
people	I
by	I
sending	I
them	I
an	I
e-mail	I
.	I
You	I
should	I
not	I
worry	I
about	I
interrupting	I
an	I
important	I
conversation	I
or	I
some	I
other	I
business	I
.	I
To	I
sum	I
up	I
,	O
I	I
would	I
like	I
to	I
say	I
that	I
for	I
me	I
both	I
options	I
of	I
communicating	I
are	I
possible	I
,	O
but	I
if	I
this	I
is	I
an	I
important	I
and	I
not	I
urgent	I
question	I
I	I
would	I
prefer	I
to	I
answer	I
it	I
by	I
means	I
of	I
internet	I
or	I
voice	I
mail	I
.	I
Living	I
with	I
a	I
roommate	I
is	I
better	I
than	I
Living	I
alone	I
Many	I
single	I
people	I
have	I
difficulties	I
deciding	I
whether	I
to	I
live	I
with	I
a	I
roommate	I
or	I
to	I
live	I
alone	I
.	I
Each	I
makes	I
different	I
decisions	I
.	I
Some	I
people	I
choose	I
to	I
live	I
alone	I
for	I
privacy	I
,	I
while	I
others	I
choose	I
to	I
live	I
with	I
a	I
roommate	I
for	I
practical	I
reasons	I
.	I
As	I
far	I
as	I
I	I
am	I
concerned	I
,	I
I	I
prefer	I
to	I
live	I
with	I
a	I
roommate	I
.	I
This	I
is	I
because	I
it	I
saves	I
me	I
money	I
,	I
enables	I
me	I
to	I
socialize	I
,	I
and	I
allows	I
me	I
to	I
get	I
help	I
.	I
Living	I
with	I
a	I
roommate	I
saves	I
me	I
a	I
lot	I
of	I
money	I
.	I
If	I
you	I
have	I
roommates	I
,	I
you	I
can	I
split	I
the	I
rent	I
and	I
utilities	I
among	I
them	I
.	I
This	I
means	I
you	I
can	I
get	I
more	I
for	I
less	I
.	I
For	I
example	I
,	I
last	I
year	I
,	I
I	I
shared	I
a	I
room	I
off-campus	I
with	I
my	I
friend	I
,	I
and	I
we	I
decided	I
to	I
split	I
the	I
rent	I
and	I
heating	I
bills	I
into	I
half	I
:	I
I	I
was	I
able	I
to	I
save	I
about	I
fifty	I
dollars	I
for	I
heating	I
,	I
and	I
two	I
hundred	I
dollars	I
for	I
rent	I
monthly	I
.	I
I	I
was	I
able	I
to	I
save	I
a	I
lot	I
of	I
money	I
by	I
sharing	I
wasted	I
heating	I
and	I
rooms	I
with	I
my	I
friend	I
and	I
splitting	I
the	I
bills	I
.	I
Apart	I
from	I
saving	I
a	I
lot	I
of	I
money	I
,	I
living	I
with	I
a	I
roommate	I
also	I
enables	I
me	I
to	I
socialize	I
more	I
easily	I
.	I
It	I
is	I
always	I
easier	I
to	I
socialize	I
when	I
you	I
have	I
a	I
lot	I
of	I
people	I
around	I
you	I
.	I
You	I
can	I
invite	I
your	I
roommates	I
'	I
friends	I
over	I
to	I
your	I
room	I
and	I
have	I
fun	I
together	I
.	I
For	I
instance	I
,	O
one	I
night	I
,	O
my	I
roommate	I
,	I
Millan	I
,	I
brought	I
his	I
friends	I
along	I
.	I
Even	I
though	I
his	I
friends	I
and	I
I	I
were	I
total	I
strangers	I
to	I
each	I
other	I
,	I
we	I
quickly	I
got	I
to	I
know	I
each	I
other	I
.	I
We	I
soon	I
found	I
out	I
that	I
everyone	I
loved	I
playing	I
video	I
games	I
.	I
We	I
played	I
a	I
video	I
game	I
called	I
'Halo	I
'	I
together	I
all	I
night	I
,	I
and	I
became	I
good	I
friends	I
.	I
Living	I
with	I
a	I
roommate	I
made	I
socializing	I
much	I
easier	I
for	I
me	I
.	I
Finally	I
,	O
living	I
with	I
a	I
roommate	I
allows	I
me	I
to	I
get	I
help	I
.	I
It	I
often	I
is	I
the	I
case	I
that	I
your	I
roommates	I
have	I
the	I
skills	I
or	I
knowledge	I
you	I
need	I
.	I
When	I
you	I
run	I
into	I
a	I
problem	I
,	I
you	I
can	I
ask	I
your	I
roommates	I
if	I
they	I
can	I
help	I
.	I
Some	I
of	I
them	I
may	I
have	I
something	I
to	I
offer	I
.	I
To	I
illustrate	I
,	O
when	I
my	I
computer	I
mysteriously	I
broke	I
down	I
,	O
I	I
dialed	I
up	I
the	I
manufacturer	I
and	I
asked	I
for	I
help	I
.	I
They	I
failed	I
to	I
give	I
me	I
any	I
useful	I
solutions	I
.	I
To	I
my	I
surprise	I
,	O
one	I
of	I
my	I
roommates	I
noticed	I
my	I
problems	I
and	I
offered	I
to	I
help	I
.	I
He	I
was	I
very	I
good	I
with	I
computers	I
,	I
and	I
he	I
managed	I
to	I
fix	I
the	I
problem	I
quickly	I
.	I
In	I
conclusion	I
,	O
while	I
many	I
people	I
decide	I
to	I
live	I
alone	I
for	I
various	I
reasons	I
,	O
I	I
prefer	I
to	I
live	I
with	I
a	I
roommate	I
,	I
and	I
I	I
always	I
will	I
.	I
This	I
is	I
because	I
it	I
offers	I
me	I
many	I
advantages	I
,	I
such	I
as	I
less	I
spending	I
,	I
more	I
socializing	I
,	I
and	I
more	I
help	I
.	I
I	I
think	I
single	I
people	I
should	I
live	I
with	I
a	I
roommate	I
,	I
if	I
they	I
want	I
to	I
enjoy	I
their	I
lives	I
.	I
One	I
or	I
two	I
close	I
friends	I
vs.	I
a	I
large	I
number	I
of	I
casual	I
acquaintances	I
There	I
is	I
no	I
need	I
for	I
me	I
to	I
put	I
any	I
emphasis	I
on	I
the	I
advantage	I
of	I
having	I
a	I
large	I
number	I
of	I
casual	I
acquaintance	I
.	I
However	I
,	O
I	I
still	I
agree	I
that	I
it	I
's	I
better	I
to	I
have	I
one	I
or	I
two	I
close	I
friends	I
than	I
to	I
have	I
a	I
large	I
number	I
of	I
casual	I
acquaintances	I
.	I
We	I
can	I
not	I
deny	I
that	I
being	I
a	I
friend	I
with	I
someone	I
is	I
different	I
from	I
only	I
being	I
acquaintant	I
.	I
First	I
,	I
it	I
's	I
not	I
easy	I
to	I
make	I
friend	I
with	I
anyone	I
.	I
I	I
believe	I
friends	I
are	I
people	I
who	I
have	I
great	I
compatibility	I
with	I
each	I
other	I
.	I
After	I
two	I
years	I
in	I
college	I
I	I
have	I
found	I
sometimes	I
there	I
is	I
more	I
differences	I
between	I
people	I
than	I
similarities	I
,	I
for	I
we	I
are	I
growing	I
in	I
the	I
different	I
families	I
and	I
was	I
educated	I
in	I
various	I
ways	I
.	I
Sometimes	I
acquaintances	I
are	I
just	I
acquaintances	I
.	I
We	I
spend	I
time	I
together	I
but	I
we	I
could	I
never	I
be	I
friend	I
.	I
So	I
,	O
it	I
's	I
much	I
easier	I
to	I
have	I
some	I
casual	I
acquaintances	I
than	I
have	I
some	I
close	I
friends	I
.	I
Second	I
,	O
close	I
friends	I
can	I
easily	I
understand	I
each	I
others	I
feelings	I
.	I
Because	I
of	I
the	I
similarity	I
I	I
talked	I
before	I
,	I
acquaintances	I
probably	I
not	I
able	I
to	I
understand	I
you	I
better	I
than	I
your	I
friends	I
.	I
Moreover	I
,	O
they	I
would	I
n't	I
even	I
spare	I
time	I
to	I
consider	I
your	I
feelings	I
.	I
Everyone	I
play	I
the	I
role	I
of	I
acquaintance	I
and	I
friend	I
at	I
the	I
same	I
time	I
.	I
Being	I
friendly	I
is	I
a	I
good	I
way	I
to	I
treat	I
a	I
acquaintance	I
but	I
way	I
not	I
enough	I
for	I
a	I
friend	I
.	I
When	I
my	I
friend	I
is	I
sick	I
,	O
I	I
would	I
not	I
only	I
ask	I
if	I
he	I
is	I
okay	I
like	I
an	I
acquaintance	I
but	I
do	I
my	I
best	I
to	I
make	I
him	I
get	I
well	I
as	I
soon	I
as	I
possible	I
.	I
If	I
my	I
friend	I
is	I
going	I
to	I
the	I
wrong	I
direction	I
in	I
his	I
life	I
trail	I
,	I
I	I
will	I
try	I
my	I
best	I
to	I
pull	I
him	I
back	I
,	I
but	I
not	I
stand	I
and	I
stare	I
like	I
it	I
's	I
not	I
of	I
my	I
business	I
.	I
And	I
I	I
believe	I
my	I
friend	I
will	I
do	I
the	I
same	I
to	I
me	I
.	I
In	I
conclusion	I
,	I
a	I
friend	I
is	I
a	I
person	I
you	I
care	I
about	I
.	I
To	I
me	I
,	O
friends	I
are	I
the	I
most	I
important	I
people	I
in	I
my	I
life	I
second	I
to	I
my	I
family	I
.	I
I	I
am	I
the	I
kind	I
of	I
person	I
who	I
has	I
only	I
one	I
or	I
two	I
close	I
friends	I
,	I
and	I
I	I
am	I
fully	I
content	I
that	I
I	I
have	I
such	I
nice	I
friends	I
.	I
If	I
someone	I
exchange	I
my	I
friends	I
with	I
thousands	I
of	I
acquaintances	I
,	I
I	I
will	I
definitely	I
say	I
NO	I
.	I
Living	I
in	I
a	I
higher	I
pace	I
is	I
better	I
There	I
is	I
a	I
hotly	I
debated	I
issue	I
over	I
whether	I
people	I
have	I
to	I
live	I
at	I
a	I
higher	I
or	I
lower	I
pace	I
,	I
and	I
this	I
topic	I
can	I
also	I
be	I
approached	I
from	I
several	I
different	I
angles	I
due	I
to	I
its	I
complexity	I
.	I
Some	I
people	I
tend	I
to	I
be	I
hurry	I
to	I
complete	I
their	I
tasks	I
,	I
while	I
others	I
seem	I
to	I
prefer	I
the	I
opposite	I
position	I
.	I
After	I
deeply	I
pondering	I
over	I
this	I
issue	I
,	I
I	I
also	I
develop	I
my	I
own	I
perspective	I
.	I
I	I
favor	I
the	I
former	I
;	I
that	I
is	I
,	I
I	I
prefer	I
to	I
live	I
in	I
a	I
higher	I
pace	I
condition	I
.	I
The	I
first	I
and	I
foremost	I
reason	I
lies	I
in	I
the	I
inevitable	I
fact	I
that	I
we	I
need	I
to	I
save	I
time	I
for	I
accomplishing	I
some	I
important	I
tasks	I
,	I
and	I
a	I
fitting	I
example	I
of	I
which	I
can	I
be	I
found	I
in	I
my	I
experience	I
of	I
missing	I
exam	I
.	I
I	I
just	I
failed	I
to	I
participate	I
in	I
the	I
university	I
entrance	I
exam	I
because	I
I	I
thought	I
I	I
had	I
enough	I
time	I
for	I
eating	I
breakfast	I
and	I
transporting	I
to	I
the	I
testing	I
place	I
;	I
while	I
I	I
was	I
stocked	I
in	I
a	I
traffic	I
jam	I
and	I
then	I
missed	I
the	I
first	I
test	I
.	I
Therefore	I
,	O
we	I
can	I
start	I
to	I
agree	I
that	I
we	I
have	I
to	I
be	I
eager	I
in	I
our	I
lives	I
.	I
Apart	I
from	I
the	I
one	I
I	I
have	I
mentioned	I
above	I
,	I
another	I
equally	I
important	I
aspect	I
is	I
keeping	I
in	I
high	I
pace	I
condition	I
can	I
prevent	I
me	I
from	I
getting	I
lazy	I
.	I
If	I
I	I
can	I
avoid	I
being	I
a	I
sluggish	I
person	I
,	I
I	I
can	I
have	I
a	I
higher	I
probability	I
of	I
fulfilling	I
my	I
dream	I
successfully	I
.	I
For	I
instance	I
,	O
I	I
had	I
spent	I
more	I
time	I
on	I
practicing	I
playing	I
piano	I
so	I
that	I
I	I
won	I
a	I
piano	I
competition	I
,	O
defeating	I
those	I
spending	I
less	I
time	I
on	I
practicing	I
.	I
Hence	I
,	O
from	I
this	I
case	I
we	I
are	I
capable	I
of	I
stating	I
that	I
keeping	I
our	I
pace	I
higher	I
is	I
important	I
.	I
Admittedly	O
,	O
on	I
the	I
other	I
hand	I
,	O
there	I
might	I
be	I
some	I
people	I
proclaiming	I
that	I
with	I
a	I
slower	I
pace	I
can	I
enjoy	I
their	I
lives	I
more	I
because	I
it	I
is	I
not	I
necessary	I
for	I
them	I
to	I
notice	I
the	I
time	I
control	I
or	I
acquire	I
the	I
fame	I
of	I
succeed	I
.	I
However	I
,	O
from	I
my	I
limited	I
understanding	I
,	O
I	I
just	I
doubt	I
the	I
credibility	I
of	I
that	I
saying	I
.	I
I	I
do	I
not	I
think	I
that	I
those	I
people	I
with	I
slower	I
pace	I
losing	I
the	I
piano	I
competition	I
can	I
be	I
really	I
happy	I
.	I
In	I
contrast	I
,	O
it	I
is	I
really	I
joyful	I
for	I
me	I
that	I
I	I
can	I
immerse	I
in	I
the	I
joy	I
of	I
the	I
victory	I
and	I
accomplishment	I
.	I
Based	I
on	I
the	I
reasons	I
demonstrated	I
above	I
,	O
I	I
believe	I
that	I
living	I
in	I
a	I
higher	I
pace	I
is	I
better	I
because	I
the	I
advantages	I
of	I
this	I
are	I
qualitatively	I
greater	I
than	I
that	I
of	I
the	I
opposite	I
.	I
In	I
other	I
words	I
,	I
I	I
prefer	I
to	I
live	I
in	I
high	I
pace	I
.	I
It	I
is	I
not	I
to	I
say	I
,	O
of	I
course	I
that	I
other	I
points	I
of	I
view	I
are	I
totally	I
without	I
merit	I
.	I
Still	I
,	O
I	I
am	I
firmly	I
convinced	I
that	I
the	I
reasons	I
I	I
proposed	I
in	I
favor	I
of	I
my	I
own	I
sentiment	I
are	I
much	I
more	I
tenable	I
and	I
plausible	I
.	I
Paying	O
more	I
money	I
is	I
the	I
only	I
motivation	I
to	I
make	I
employees	I
work	I
harder	I
The	I
purpose	I
of	I
this	I
essay	I
is	I
to	I
discuss	I
whether	I
or	I
not	I
the	I
only	I
way	I
to	I
motivate	I
employees	I
to	I
be	I
more	I
hard-working	I
and	I
productive	I
is	I
by	I
raising	I
their	I
salaries	I
.	I
In	I
this	I
essay	I
,	O
I	I
would	I
start	I
by	I
analyzing	I
the	I
factors	I
for	I
higher	I
yields	I
and	I
finish	I
by	I
stating	I
my	I
position	I
on	I
this	I
.	I
A	I
raise	I
or	I
a	I
promotion	I
can	I
no	I
doubt	I
increase	I
the	I
morale	I
in	I
the	I
working	I
places	I
.	I
Workers	I
understand	I
they	I
have	I
to	I
work	I
harder	I
to	I
meet	I
the	I
boss	I
'	I
expectations	I
and	I
to	I
make	I
themselves	I
worthwhile	I
.	I
For	I
instance	I
,	O
junior	I
high	I
school	I
teachers	I
have	I
great	I
responsibility	I
not	I
only	I
for	I
students	I
'	I
private	I
lives	I
as	I
they	I
are	I
going	I
through	I
adolescence	I
but	I
also	I
their	I
school	I
work	I
due	I
to	I
the	I
fact	I
that	I
it	I
is	I
an	I
important	I
phase	I
for	I
them	I
to	I
study	I
hard	I
and	I
get	I
into	I
the	I
high	I
school	I
they	I
want	I
.	I
If	I
the	I
teachers	I
receive	I
higher	I
salaries	I
,	O
they	I
will	I
be	I
willing	I
to	I
spend	I
more	I
extra	I
time	I
mentoring	I
the	I
youngsters	I
rather	I
than	I
hoping	I
they	I
learn	I
in	I
cram	I
schools	I
and	I
so	I
forth	I
,	O
as	I
this	I
is	I
what	I
is	I
happening	I
in	I
Taiwan	I
.	I
Nevertheless	I
,	O
I	I
believe	I
that	I
creating	I
an	I
enjoyable	I
working	I
environment	I
is	I
more	I
realistic	I
and	I
essential	I
if	I
one	I
wishes	I
an	I
increase	I
in	I
productivity	I
and	I
better	I
employee	I
performances	I
.	I
Take	I
Google	I
for	I
example	I
,	I
the	I
company	I
offers	I
recreation	I
rooms	I
and	I
extra	I
personal	I
leaves	I
for	I
their	I
workers	I
to	I
develop	I
a	I
more	I
relaxing	I
and	I
supportive	I
workforce	I
.	I
By	O
doing	I
this	I
,	O
the	I
employers	I
can	I
make	I
sure	I
the	I
employees	I
can	I
actually	I
focus	I
and	I
concentrate	I
on	I
their	I
projects	I
instead	I
of	I
thinking	I
about	I
their	I
children	I
or	I
feeling	I
pressured	I
.	I
To	I
sum	I
up	I
,	O
I	I
believe	I
that	I
a	I
higher	I
pay	I
can	I
be	I
one	I
of	I
the	I
incentive	I
if	I
were	I
to	I
encourage	I
harder-working	I
employees	I
.	I
Alternatively	O
,	O
providing	I
a	I
more	I
secured	I
and	I
relaxing	I
environment	I
for	I
workers	I
can	I
fundamentally	I
boost	I
their	I
productivity	I
since	I
they	I
will	I
be	I
feeling	I
more	I
cared	I
for	I
and	I
therefore	I
do	I
their	I
best	I
for	I
their	I
bosses	I

	O
Where	I
to	I
learn	I
a	I
new	I
language	I
?	O
Although	O
there	I
are	I
some	I
advantages	I
to	I
learning	I
a	I
foreign	I
language	I
in	I
its	I
original	I
country	I

I	I
firmly	I
believe	I
that	I

who	I
learn	I
a	I
foreign	I
language	I
in	I
the	I
country	I
in	I
which	I
it	I
is	I

have	I
a	I
deeper	I

those	I

Person	I
'	I
A	I
'	I
who	I
learns	I
a	I
non-native	I

his	I

a	I
step-by-step	I

he	I

all	I
these	I
people	I
most	I
likely	I
have	I
learned	I
the	I
language	I
,	O
more	I
or	I
less	I
,	O
in	I
the	I
same	I
way	I
.	I
On	I
the	I
other	I
hand	I
,	O
when	I
a	I
new	I
learner	I
wants	I
to	I
learn	I
a	I
new	I
language	I
in	I
the	I
country	I
in	I
which	I
it	I
is	I
spoken	I
,	O
he	I
has	I
the	I
opportunity	I
to	I
communicate	I
with	I
natives	I
.	I
He	I
may	I
find	I
native	I
friends	I
and	I
may	I
participate	I
in	I
groups	I
where	I
members	I
are	I
people	I
from	I
the	I
foreign	I
country	I
.	I
No	I
doubt	I
,	O
it	I
leads	I
to	I
better	I
understanding	I
of	I
language	I
essential	I
skills	I
.	I
He	I
also	I
has	I
access	I
to	I
the	I
most	I
up-to-date	I
language	I
.	I
Thus	I
he	I
can	I
learn	I
most	I
useful	I
idioms	I
,	O
proverbs	I
and	I
so	I
many	I
other	I
things	I
which	I
the	I
former	I
person	I
,	O
person	I
'	I
A	I
'	I
,	O
does	I
not	I
have	I
access	I
to	I
.	I
On	I
the	I
whole	I
,	O
if	I
I	I
wanted	I
to	I
learn	I
a	I
new	I
language	I
and	I
had	I
enough	I
money	I
to	I
afford	I
the	I
travel	I
,	I
I	I
would	I
definitely	I
make	I
the	I
second	I
choice	I
.	I
There	I
are	I
lots	I
of	I
evidences	I
show	I
that	I
communication	I
is	I
the	I
most	I
important	I
factor	I
in	I
learning	I
a	I
new	I
language	I
.	I
When	I
you	I
are	I
exposed	I
to	I
an	I
environment	I
where	I
everybody	I
talks	I
to	I
you	I
in	I
the	I
new	I
language	I
you	I
want	I
to	I
learn	I
and	I
expects	I
you	I
express	I
words	I
from	I
the	I
same	I
language	I
,	I
you	I
are	I
forced	I
to	I
learn	I
it	I
as	I
soon	I
and	I
good	I
as	I
possible	I
.	I
In	I
a	I
word	I
,	O
although	I
each	I
of	I
these	I
methods	I
have	I
their	I
pros	I
and	I
cons	I
,	O
I	I
am	I
pretty	I
sure	I
that	I
advantages	I
of	I
learning	I
language	I
in	I
the	I
country	I
in	I
which	I
is	I
spoken	I
outweigh	I
the	I
advantages	I
of	I
the	I
other	I
way	I
of	I
learning	I
of	I
a	I
new	I
language	I
.	I
Most	I
difficult	I
experiences	I
will	I
become	I
valuable	I
lessons	I
There	I
is	I
a	I
famous	I
old	I
saying	I
that	I
failure	I
is	I
the	I
mother	I
of	I
success	I
.	I
For	I
that	I
reason	I
,	O
some	I
people	I
advocate	I
that	I
some	I
difficulties	I
people	I
met	I
at	I
their	I
early	I
ages	I
will	I
become	I
an	I
invaluable	I
fortune	I
in	I
their	I
future	I
lives	I
.	I
However	I
,	O
some	I
people	I
think	I
it	I
is	I
n't	I
supposed	I
to	I
be	I
that	I
case	I
.	I
From	I
my	I
point	I
of	I
view	I
,	O
I	I
am	I
in	I
favor	I
the	I
former	I
statement	I
that	I
some	I
tough	I
experiences	I
people	I
met	I
before	I
will	I
be	I
helpful	I
in	I
their	I
life	I
path	I
.	I
To	I
start	I
with	I
,	O
hardship	I
makes	I
people	I
realize	I
how	I
to	I
cherish	I
and	I
compliment	I
the	I
common	I
but	I
wonderful	I
little	I
things	I
happened	I
in	I
their	I
life	I
such	I
as	I
,	O
a	I
shining	I
weather	I
,	I
a	I
delicious	I
breakfast	I
and	I
etc	I
.	I
People	I
who	I
have	I
such	I
nice	I
spirit	I
usually	I
know	I
how	I
to	I
find	I
the	I
true	I
love	I
in	I
their	I
life	I
instead	I
of	I
being	I
seduced	I
by	I
greed	I
as	I
to	I
lose	I
themselves	I
in	I
the	I
end	I
.	I
As	I
a	I
result	I
,	O
experiences	I
of	I
difficulties	I
teach	I
them	I
how	I
to	I
keep	I
a	I
nice	I
mood	I
and	I
have	I
confidence	I
all	I
the	I
time	I
.	I
What	I
's	I
more	I
,	O
people	I
who	I
experienced	I
lots	I
of	I
difficulties	I
will	I
be	I
calmer	I
when	I
they	I
are	I
in	I
troubles	I
.	I
Because	I
they	I
already	I
have	I
such	I
experiences	I
of	I
overcoming	I
some	I
difficulties	I
,	I
they	I
are	I
conscious	I
of	I
what	I
to	I
do	I
and	I
how	I
to	I
do	I
when	I
fierce	I
crisis	I
happens	I
.	I
Those	I
people	I
are	I
more	I
likely	I
to	I
achieve	I
their	I
ambitions	I
in	I
their	I
career	I
because	I
they	I
are	I
aware	I
of	I
how	I
to	I
lead	I
people	I
to	I
reach	I
success	I
despite	I
what	I
kind	I
of	I
difficulties	I
are	I
getting	I
in	I
their	I
way	I
.	I
So	O
,	O
to	I
sum	I
it	I
up	I
,	O
both	I
not	I
afraid	I
of	I
difficulties	I
and	I
appreciating	I
common	I
but	I
pleasant	I
things	I
in	I
their	I
lives	I
drive	I
me	I
to	I
believe	I
that	I
most	I
tough	I
experiences	I
in	I
people	I
's	I
life	I
path	I
will	I
be	I
a	I
priceless	I
treasure	I
to	I
them	I
.	I
Remember	I
if	I
you	I
are	I
afraid	I
of	I
encountering	I
difficulties	I
,	I
then	I
you	I
will	I
be	I
in	I
the	I
troubles	I
all	I
the	I
time	I

Replacing	I
old	I
buildings	I
is	I
important	I
for	I
any	I
city	I
but	I
it	I
should	I
not	I

It	I
is	I
important	I
for	I
any	I
city	I
to	I
replace	I
old	I
buildings	I
with	I
new	I
ones	I
,	I
but	I
these	I
revolutions	I
should	I
not	I
include	I
historic	I
buildings	I

The	I
historic	I
buildings	I
show	I
the	I
history	I
of	I
our	I
ancestors	I
.	I
In	I
addition	I
,	O
they	I
can	I
develop	I
tourism	I
industries	I
by	I
attracting	I
tourists	I
.	I
Historic	I
buildings	I
answer	I
many	I
questions	I
,	I
which	I
are	I
mysterious	I
about	I
our	I
previous	I
ancestors	I
;	I
thereby	I
no	I
one	I
can	I
determine	I
the	I
price	I
of	I
the	I
historic	I
buildings	I
.	I
They	I
show	I
the	I
history	I
of	I
nations	I
and	I
previous	I
generations	I
who	I
lived	I
in	I
the	I
city	I
.	I
They	I
show	I
the	I
lifestyle	I
of	I
people	I
who	I
lived	I
in	I
thousands	I
of	I
years	I
ago	I
.	I
They	I
show	I
us	I
how	I
they	I
survive	I
,	I
or	I
how	I
they	I
defend	I
themselves	I
etc	I
.	I
By	I
investigating	I
about	I
their	I
structures	I
,	I
we	I
can	I
understand	I
how	I
much	I
they	I
knew	I
about	I
the	I
architecture	I
of	I
building	I
.	I
In	I
the	I
other	I
hand	I
,	O
historic	I
buildings	I
are	I
important	I
treasures	I
,	O
which	I
provide	I
an	I
area	I
to	I
learn	I
valuable	I
lessons	I
.	I
Another	I
advantage	I
of	I
historic	I
buildings	I
is	I
their	I
capabilities	I
to	I
attract	I
more	I
tourists	I
to	I
the	I
city	I
.	I
It	I
is	I
interesting	I
for	I
most	I
people	I
to	I
know	I
about	I
the	I
way	I
people	I
live	I
in	I
thousands	I
years	I
ago	I
.	I
Therefore	I
,	O
It	I
is	I
a	I
valuable	I
opportunities	I
for	I
any	I
city	I
having	I
historic	I
buildings	I
to	I
show	I
them	I
to	I
new	I
visitors	I
.	I
Historic	I
building	I
can	I
develop	I
other	I
industries	I
such	I
as	I
restaurants	I
or	I
other	I
food	I
industries	I
and	I
handicrafts	I
shops	I
and	I
so	I
on	I
.	I
These	I
are	I
reasons	I
that	I
why	I
we	I
should	I
preserve	I
historic	I
buildings	I
in	I
the	I
city	I
.	I
They	I
can	I
benefit	I
us	I
financially	I
by	I
developing	I
other	I
industries	I
.	I
Moreover	I
,	O
they	I
are	I
the	I
symbols	I
of	I
our	I
nations	I
,	O
which	I
can	I
show	I
the	I
historical	I

Public	I
transportation	I
keeps	I
society	I
from	I
the	I
depletion	I
of	I

The	I
development	I
of	I
public	I

is	I
the	I
most	I
essential	I
thing	I
for	I
a	I
developed	I
society	I

Public	I
transportation	I
keeps	I
society	I
from	I
the	I

the	I
air	I

,	O
the	I
loss	I
of	I
a	I
sense	I
of	I
community	I

So	I
,	O
I	I
think	I
the	I
government	I
have	I
to	I
spend	I
more	I
money	I
on	I
improving	I
it	I

The	I
use	I

is	I
the	I
best	I
way	I
to	I
conserve	I
natural	I
resources	I
gradually	I
run	I
out	I
.	I
Cars	I
depend	I
on	I
oil	I
and	I
gasoline	I
to	I
move	I
.	I
If	I
people	I
use	I
too	I
many	I
private	I
cars	I
,	I
the	I
oil	I
and	I
gasoline	I
nonrenewable	I
will	I
run	I
out	I
quickly	I
.	I
Instead	I
of	I
using	I
many	I
private	I
cars	I
,	O
people	I
can	I
use	I
public	I
transportation	I
,	O
such	I
as	I
bus	I
,	O
train	I
,	O
subway	I
,	O
each	I
one	I
can	I
get	I
far	I
more	I
people	I
and	I
less	I
oil	I
and	I
gasoline	I
are	I
used	I
up	I
per	I
person	I
.	I
The	I
use	I
of	I
public	I
transportation	I
helps	I
in	I
reducing	I
the	I
air	I
pollution	I
.	I
Cars	I
use	I
oil	I
and	I
gasoline	I
and	I
send	I
out	I
gas	I
such	I
as	I
carbon	I
dioxide	I
,	I
heat	I
and	I
so	I
on	I
.	I
They	I
cause	I
pollution	I
and	I
make	I
the	I
Earth	I
warmer	I
.	I
The	I
more	I
cars	I
are	I
driven	I
,	I
the	I
more	I
pollution	I
will	I
be	I
put	I
into	I
air	I
.	I
If	I
we	I
use	I
the	I
public	I
transportation	I
,	I
less	I
cars	I
will	I
be	I
used	I
and	I
less	I
pollution	I
will	I
be	I
emitted	I

The	I
atmosphere	I
,	O
surrounding	I
us	I
,	O
will	I
be	I
protected	I
and	I
help	I
us	I
more	I
healthy	I
.	I
The	I
use	I
of	I
public	I
transportation	I
make	I
us	I
live	I
more	I
sociable	I
.	I
When	I
we	I
drive	I
a	I
private	I
car	I
,	O
we	I
are	I
alone	I
or	I
only	I
our	I
family	I
members	I
that	I
we	I
already	I
know	I
and	I
lost	I
the	I
opportunity	I
to	I
make	I
friends	I
with	I
others	I
or	I
to	I
see	I
that	I
we	I
are	I
a	I
part	I
of	I
this	I
society	I
.	I
When	I
using	I
public	I
transportation	I
,	O
we	I
have	I
a	I
chance	I
to	I
meet	I
more	I
people	I
and	I
more	I
chances	I
to	I
discovery	I
new	I
aspects	I
of	I
life	I
.	I
Using	I
public	I
transportation	I
has	I
a	I
lot	I
of	I
advantages	I
for	I
the	I
modern	I
society	I
facing	I
a	I
lot	I
of	I
problems	I
:	I
the	I
environmental	I
population	I
,	I
the	I
isolation	I
in	I
life	I
,	O
the	I
depletion	I
of	I
natural	I
resources	I
.	I
So	I
,	O
the	I
government	I
have	I
to	I
invest	I
more	I
for	I
it	I
and	I
encourage	I
people	I
to	I

Roles	I
of	I
international	I
sports	I
events	I
Whenever	I
an	I
international	I
sporting	I
occasion	I
like	I
the	I
football	I
World	I
Cup	I
takes	I
place	I
,	I
it	I
attracts	I
millions	I
of	I
people	I
all	I
over	I
the	I
world	I
.	I
As	I
sport	I
has	I
become	I
a	I
common	I
passion	I
which	I
passed	I
over	I
every	I
national	I
border	I
,	I
popular	I
sports	I
events	I
can	I
help	I
reduce	I
international	I
tensions	I
remarkably	I
and	I
promote	I
national	I
prides	I
safely	I
.	I
First	O
and	I
foremost	I
,	O
sports	I
events	I
are	I
good	I
chances	I
for	I
excellent	I
athletes	I
to	I
meet	I
and	I
learn	I
valuable	I
experiences	I
from	I
one	I
another	I
so	I
that	I
they	I
can	I
improve	I
their	I
results	I
,	O
break	I
records	I
and	I
bring	I
victories	I
to	I
their	I
own	I
countries	I
.	I
Because	I
a	I
large	I
number	I
of	I
people	I
will	I
gather	I
in	I
the	I
host	I
city	I
for	I
sport	I
events	I
,	I
there	I
are	I
many	I
good	I
opportunities	I
for	I
discovering	I
different	I
cultures	I
.	I
Consequently	I
,	O
sport	I
events	I
with	I
the	I
spirit	I
of	I
healthiness	I
,	O
honesty	I
and	I
fairness	I
can	I
help	I
strengthen	I
understanding	I
,	I
friendship	I
and	I
solidarity	I
among	I
nations	I
.	I
After	I
sharing	I
competitive	I
but	I
interesting	I
moments	I
in	I
each	I
competition	I
,	I
the	I
competitors	I
often	I
shake	I
hands	I
friendly	I
and	I
congratulate	I
the	I
winners	I
,	I
which	I
can	I
lead	I
to	I
an	I
improvement	I
in	I
the	I
relationships	I
among	I
nations	I
.	I
Secondly	I
,	O
sporting	I
occasions	I
play	I
an	I
essential	I
role	I
in	I
raising	I
patriotic	I
emotions	I
in	I
both	I
athletes	I
and	I
spectators	I
.	I
Seeing	I
national	I
flags	I
be	I
honored	I
may	I
be	I
the	I
most	I
emotional	I
moments	I
to	I
each	I
athlete	I
.	I
The	I
athlete	I
also	I
seems	I
to	I
be	I
more	I
aware	I
of	I
his	I
responsibilities	I
and	I
he	I
wants	I
to	I
contribute	I
more	I
to	I
his	I
beloved	I
country	I
.	I
When	I
witnessing	I
our	I
national	I
flags	I
flying	I
proudly	I
among	I
others	I
,	I
many	I
of	I
us	I
can	I
stop	I
hiding	I
our	I
pride	I
and	I
happiness	I
.	I
For	I
instance	I
,	O
when	I
Vietnam	I
became	I
the	I
champion	I
of	I
SEAGAMES	I
for	I
the	I
first	I
time	I
in	I
2008	I
,	I
a	I
festival	I
atmosphere	I
permeated	I
into	I
the	I
streets	I
.	I
People	I
from	I
all	I
ages	I
turned	I
out	I
to	I
the	I
streets	I
with	I
flags	I
,	I
banners	I
and	I
they	I
sang	I
aloud	I
songs	I
of	I
Ho	I
Chi	I
Minh	I
President	I
.	I
The	I
eager	I
atmosphere	I
lasted	I
many	I
next	I
days	I
.	I
In	I
fact	I
,	I
some	I
hooligans	I
were	I
so	I
excited	I
that	I
they	I
took	I
part	I
in	I
motor	I
racing	I
or	I
using	I
fireworks	I
illegally	I
.	I
However	I
,	O
the	I
hooligans	I
only	I
took	I
a	I
minority	I
of	I
people	I
.	I
Therefore	I
,	O
it	I
can	I
be	I
said	I
that	I
sport	I
events	I
help	I
to	I
wake	I
up	I
love	I
and	I
responsibilities	I
strongly	I
in	I
each	I
citizen	I
.	I
In	I
conclusion	I
,	O
international	I
sporting	I
occasions	I
are	I
not	I
only	I
one	I
of	I
the	I
effective	I
solutions	I
to	I
tensions	I
among	I
nations	I
but	I
also	I
a	I
stimulant	I
for	I
releasing	I
patriotic	I
emotions	I
safely	I
.	I
Hence	I
,	O
I	I
recommend	I
that	I
big	I
sports	I
events	I
should	I
be	I
held	I

Apartments	I
vs	I
dormitories	I
at	I
university	I
Many	I
students	I
prefer	I
to	I
live	I
in	I
the	I
university	I
dormitories	I
while	I
others	I
prefer	I
an	I
apartment	I
in	I
the	I
city	I
.	I
Both	I
options	I
have	I
their	I
advantages	I
and	I
disadvantages	I
.	I
After	I
considering	I
the	I
level	I
of	I
freedom	I
,	O
the	I
studying	I
conditions	I
and	I
the	I
economic	I
factor	I
,	O
if	I
I	I
had	I
to	I
choose	I
,	O
I	I
would	I
prefer	I
to	I
live	I
in	I
an	I
apartment	I
in	I
the	I
community	I
rather	I
than	I
in	I
the	I
university	I
dormitories	I
.	I
First	I
,	O
an	I
apartment	I
provides	I
a	I
lot	I
more	I
freedom	I
than	I
a	I
dormitory	I
.	I
While	I
in	I
a	I
dormitory	I
you	I
have	I
to	I
obey	I
preset	I
rules	I
,	I
in	I
the	I
apartment	I
you	I
set	I
your	I
own	I
rules	I
.	I
You	I
are	I
free	I
to	I
have	I
visits	I
at	I
any	I
time	I
or	I
to	I
be	I
left	I
alone	I
if	I
you	I
want	I
.	I
An	I
apartment	I
offers	I
more	I
privacy	I
because	I
you	I
can	I
choose	I
to	I
have	I
your	I
own	I
room	I
instead	I
of	I
sharing	I
with	I
another	I
student	I
.	I
This	I
is	I
an	I
important	I
factor	I
because	I
you	I
also	I
get	I
more	I
space	I
than	I
you	I
would	I
in	I
a	I
dormitory	I
.	I
Second	I
,	O
from	I
an	I
economic	I
point	I
of	I
view	I
,	O
people	I
often	I
argue	I
that	I
an	I
apartment	I
is	I
more	I
expensive	I
.	I
This	I
is	I
only	I
partially	I
true	I
,	O
you	I
could	I
rent	I
the	I
extra	I
rooms	I
in	I
the	I
apartment	I
to	I
other	I
people	I
and	I
rent	I
would	I
be	I
a	I
lot	I
cheaper	I
.	I
Transportation	I
is	I
another	I
issue	I
,	I
you	I
have	I
to	I
go	I
to	I
and	I
return	I
from	I
the	I
university	I
everyday	I
.	I
You	I
could	I
choose	I
to	I
use	I
public	I
transportation	I
,	I
a	I
cheaper	I
option	I
,	I
or	I
to	I
have	I
a	I
car	I
.	I
The	I
car	I
is	I
an	I
expensive	I
option	I
,	O
but	I
also	I
offers	I
freedom	I
of	I
schedule	I
and	I
destination	I
.	I
Lastly	I
,	O
the	I
studying	I
conditions	I
are	I
better	I
in	I
an	I
apartment	I
because	I
you	I
do	I
n't	I
have	I
all	I
the	I
noise	I
and	I
distractions	I
that	I
you	I
often	I
have	I
in	I
dormitories	I
.	I
A	I
lot	I
of	I
students	I
often	I
complain	I
about	I
their	I
roommate	I
playing	I
music	I
too	I
loud	I
or	I
bringing	I
friends	I
over	I
at	I
inappropriate	I
times	I
.	I
Since	I
in	I
an	I
apartment	I
you	I
do	I
n't	I
have	I
a	I
roommate	I
,	I
you	I
wo	I
n't	I
have	I
this	I
problem	I
,	I
and	I
as	I
a	I
result	I
you	I
would	I
be	I
able	I
to	I
concentrate	I
better	I
.	I
For	I
the	I
same	I
reason	I
,	O
you	I
wo	I
n't	I
have	I
a	I
problem	I
if	I
you	I
are	I
the	I
one	I
who	I
wants	I
to	I
play	I
music	I
,	O
bring	I
friends	I
over	I
,	I
or	I
study	I
late	I
at	I
night	I
.	I
You	I
set	I
your	I
own	I
schedules	I
.	I
In	I
the	I
other	I
hand	I
,	O
living	I
in	I
a	I
dormitory	I
,	O
and	I
being	I
surrounded	I
by	I
students	I
also	I
has	I
some	I
advantages	I
,	O
like	I
being	I
able	I
to	I
get	I
help	I
with	I
any	I
academic	I
issues	I
from	I
them	I
.	I
To	I
conclude	I
,	O
both	I
options	I
have	I
their	I
advantages	I
,	O
but	I
personally	I
I	I
think	I
the	I
advantages	I
of	I
living	I
in	I
an	I
apartment	I
outshine	I
those	I
of	I
living	I
in	I
a	I
dormitory	I
.	I
Living	I
and	I
studying	I
overseas	I
It	I
is	I
every	I
student	I
's	I
desire	I
to	I
study	I
at	I
a	I
good	I
university	I
and	I
experience	I
a	I
new	I
environment	I
.	I
While	I
some	I
students	I
study	I
and	I
live	I
overseas	I
to	I
achieve	I
this	I
,	I
some	I
prefer	I
to	I
study	I
home	I
because	I
of	I
the	I
difficulties	I
of	I
living	I
and	I
studying	I
overseas	I
.	I
In	I
my	I
opinion	I
,	O
one	I
who	I
studies	I
overseas	I
will	I
gain	I
many	I
skills	I
throughout	I
this	I
experience	I
for	I
several	I
reasons	I
.	I
First	I
,	O
studying	I
at	I
an	I
overseas	I
university	I
gives	I
individuals	I
the	I
opportunity	I
to	I
improve	I
social	I
skills	I
by	I
interacting	I
and	I
communicating	I
with	I
students	I
from	I
different	I
origins	I
and	I
cultures	I
.	I
Compared	I
to	I
the	I
peers	I
studying	I
in	I
the	I
home	I
country	I
,	O
it	I
will	I
be	I
more	I
likely	I
for	I
the	I
one	I
who	I
is	I
living	I
overseas	I
to	I
be	I
successful	I
in	I
adapting	I
himself/herself	I
into	I
new	I
environments	I
and	I
situations	I
in	I
life	I
.	I
Second	I
,	O
living	I
and	I
studying	I
overseas	I
is	I
an	I
irreplaceable	I
experience	I
when	I
it	I
comes	I
to	I
learn	I
standing	I
on	I
your	I
own	I
feet	I
.	I
One	I
who	I
is	I
living	I
overseas	I
will	I
of	I
course	I
struggle	I
with	I
loneliness	I
,	O
living	I
away	I
from	I
family	I
and	I
friends	I
but	I
those	I
difficulties	I
will	I
turn	I
into	I
valuable	I
experiences	I
in	I
the	I
following	I
steps	I
of	I
life	I
.	I
Moreover	I
,	O
the	I
one	I
will	I
learn	I
living	I
without	I
depending	I
on	I
anyone	I
else	I
.	I
Also	I
,	O
employers	I
are	I
mostly	I
looking	I
for	I
people	I
who	I
have	I
international	I
and	I
language	I
skills	I
.	I
Becoming	I
successful	I
in	I
this	I
study	I
will	I
give	I
the	I
student	I
an	I
edge	I
in	I
job	I
market	I
.	I
Therefore	I
,	O
one	I
who	I
has	I
studied	I
and	I
lived	I
overseas	I
will	I
become	I
more	I
eligible	I
for	I
the	I
job	I
than	I
his/her	I
peers	I
.	I
In	I
conclusion	I
,	O
there	I
are	I
many	I
difficulties	I
a	I
student	I
might	I
face	I
when	I
studying	I
and	I
living	I
overseas	I
.	I
However	I
,	O
living	I
and	I
studying	I
overseas	I
gives	I
the	I
individual	I
a	I
new	I
perspective	I
on	I
the	I
subject	I
that	I
is	I
studied	I
or	I
in	I

	O
Advantages	I
and	I
disadvantages	I
of	I
the	I
prevalent	I
of	I
English	I
With	I
the	I
development	I
of	I
globalization	I
,	I
English	I
became	I
the	I
dominated	I
language	I
in	I
national	I
trade	I
,	I
conference	I
and	I
many	I
important	I
events	I

This	I
phenomenon	I
has	I
aroused	I
a	I
heated	I
discussion	I
in	I
public	I

Some	I
people	I
claim	I
that	I
the	I
prevalent	I
of	I
English	I
brings	I
a	I
great	I
number	I
of	I
benefits	I
for	I
people	I

First	I
of	I
all	I
,	O
it	I
promotes	I
the	I
communication	I
and	I
interaction	I
between	I
different	I
countries	I
more	I
conveniently	I
and	I
clearly	I
.	I
In	I
the	I
ancient	I
time	I
,	O
the	I
different	I
languages	I
and	I
geography	I
set	I
barriers	I
for	I
people	I
to	I
exchange	I
their	I
goods	I
and	I
ideas	I
.	I
Fortunately	I
,	O
the	I
innovation	I
of	I
plane	I
and	I
train	I
solved	I
the	I
geographical	I
barriers	I
.	I
If	I
we	I
can	I
popularize	I
the	I
use	I
of	I
English	I
,	O
the	I
language	I
hinder	I
will	I
disappear	I
as	I
well	I
.	I
In	I
addition	I
,	O
English	I
is	I
a	I
beautiful	I
language	I
,	O
which	I
is	I
more	I
systematical	I
and	I
extensive	I
than	I
many	I
other	I
languages	I
.	I
Learning	I
English	I
can	I
foster	I
people	I
's	I
sentiment	I
and	I
nourish	I
their	I
literature	I
and	I
art	I
.	I
However	I
,	O
the	I
opponents	I
believe	I
that	I
the	I
dominated	I
status	I
of	I
English	I
has	I
destroyed	I
culture	I
diversity	I
and	I
many	I
less-used	I
languages	I
become	I
extinct	I

Even	I
English	I
is	I
a	I
sophisticated	I
language	I
;	I
it	I
does	I
not	I
express	I
every	I
detail	I
of	I
life	I
especially	I
in	I
Asia	I
countries	I
,	I
which	I
have	I
totally	I
different	I
linguistic	I
system	I

It	I
is	I
undeniable	I
that	I
language	I
contains	I
many	I
aspects	I
of	I
people	I
's	I
daily	I
life	I

which	I
is	I
influenced	I
by	I
culture	I

as	I
well	I
as	I
religious	I

Obviously	I
,	O
these	I
languages	I
have	I
special	I
significance	I
for	I
people	I
who	I
belong	I
to	I
them	I
and	I
using	I
English	I
to	I
replace	I
them	I
is	I
crudity	I
.	I
Personally	I
,	O
English	I
as	I
an	I
elegant	I
language	I
should	I
be	I
advocated	I
in	I
many	I
fields	I
to	I
expand	I
the	I
global	I
trade	I
and	I
communications	I

But	I
,	O
we	I
still	I
need	I
preserve	I
other	I

for	I
sake	I
of	I
keeping	I
the	I
linguistic	I

.	I
	O
A	I
more	I
convenient	I
life	I
in	I
a	I
city	I
There	I
are	I
undeniable	I
advantages	I
to	I
both	I
life	I
in	I
a	I
big	I
city	I
and	I
in	I
a	I
small	I
town	I

The	I
former	I
offers	I
more	I

convenience	I
while	I
the	I

offers	I
a	I
cleaner	I

quieter	I

However	I
,	O
despite	I
the	I

of	I

I	I

On	I
the	I
one	I

to	I

a	I

company	I
which	I

in	I
a	I
prosperous	I
city	I

To	I
make	I
it	I
convenient	I

I	I
will	I
absolutely	I
choose	I

that	I
is	I

I	I
can	I

I	I
choose	I
to	I
live	I
in	I
the	I
city	I

On	I
the	I
other	I
hand	I
,	O
life	I
in	I
a	I
big	I
city	I
will	I
not	I
be	I
so	I
dull	I
as	I
in	I
a	I
small	I
town	I

You	I
can	I
enjoy	I
modern	I
life	I

have	I
more	I
access	I
to	I

For	I

you	I
can	I
visit	I
museums	I
to	I
learn	I
history	I
,	O
and	I
go	I
to	I
a	I
more	I
equipped	I
library	I
to	I
enjoy	I
reading	I
,	I
or	I
you	I
can	I
go	I
to	I
a	I
sports	I
center	I
for	I
exercising	I
.	I
But	I
a	I
small	I
town	I
may	I
be	I
less	I
developed	I
to	I
satisfy	I
all	I
these	I
kinds	I
of	I
needs	I
.	I
Furthermore	I
living	I
in	I
big	I
cities	I
means	I
more	I
exposure	I
to	I
stimulation	I

all	I
kinds	I
of	I
information	I

If	I
one	I

the	I
information	I

there	I
might	I

along	I
more	I
opportunities	I
for	I
him	I

his	I
goals	I

For	I
example	I

there	I

whether	I
on	I
the	I

right	I
in	I
the	I
city	I

planing	I
somewhere	I
to	I
travel	I

just	I
wants	I
to	I
buy	I
a	I
product	I
in	I
a	I
dependable	I
store	I

he	I
might	I
refer	I
to	I
what	I
he	I
has	I
seen	I
or	I
heard	I
from	I
the	I
advertisements	I
to	I
make	I
a	I
relatively	I
wise	I
choice	I
.	I
There	I
is	I
also	I
another	I
obvious	I
advantage	I
of	I
living	I
in	I
a	I
big	I
city	I
considering	I
the	I
chance	I
of	I
receiving	I
better	I
education	I
of	I
our	I
offspring	I

Schools	I
in	I
big	I

more	I
funds	I
from	I
whether	I
the	I

the	I

a	I
better	I
chance	I

pursuing	I
high-quality	I
education	I
which	I
is	I
very	I
important	I
for	I
their	I
future	I

In	I
conclusion	O

if	I
I	I

to	I

a	I

my	I
children	I

the	I

Protect	I
animals	I
or	I
not	I
?	O
Many	I
animals	I
today	I
are	I
in	I
danger	I
of	I
extinction	I
owing	I
to	I
various	I
reasons	I
.	I
While	I
some	I
people	I
believe	I
it	I
is	I
important	I
to	I
protect	I
these	I
endangered	I
species	I
,	I
others	I
argue	I
that	I
problems	I
of	I
human	I
beings	I
deserve	I
more	I
attention	I
.	I
In	I
my	I
opinion	I
,	I
we	I
should	I
give	I
priority	I
to	I
our	I
own	I
issues	I
.	I
Animal	I
protectionists	I
may	I
base	I
their	I
argument	I
on	I
the	I
ground	I
that	I
biodiversity	I
is	I
essential	I
to	I
maintain	I
the	I
balance	I
of	I
ecosystem	I
.	I
If	I
certain	I
species	I
are	I
absent	I
from	I
this	I
system	I
,	I
such	I
kind	I
of	I
balance	I
is	I
likely	I
to	I
be	I
disrupted	I
and	I
other	I
species	I
,	O
including	I
human	I
beings	I
,	O
will	I
come	I
under	I
threat	I

Therefore	I
,	O
it	I
is	I
our	I
responsibility	I
to	I
keep	I
as	I
many	I
species	I
on	I
the	I
Earth	I
as	I
possible	I
.	I
However	I
,	O
I	I
think	I
species	I
extinction	I
is	I
quite	I
natural	I
according	I
to	I
the	I
theory	I
of	I
evolution	I

The	I

many	I
times	I
since	I
the	I
first	I
species	I
came	I
into	I
being	I

A	I
great	I
number	I
of	I
plants	I
and	I
animals	I
died	I
out	I
because	I
they	I
were	I
unable	I
to	I
fit	I
into	I
the	I

environment	I

On	I
most	I
occasions	I
,	O
the	I
process	I
of	I
extinction	I
of	I
some	I
species	I
is	I
irrevocable	I
and	I
we	I
can	I
do	I
nothing	I
about	I
it	I

Furthermore	I
,	O
human	I

nowadays	I

with	I
many	I
urgent	I
problems	I
such	I
as	I
starvation	I

When	I
these	I

are	I
taken	I
into	I
account	I
,	O
extinction	I
of	I
some	I
animals	I
recedes	I
greatly	I
in	I
importance	I
and	I
it	I
is	I
not	I
sensible	I
to	I
devote	I
our	I
limited	I
resources	I
to	I
animals	I
that	I
have	I
been	I
past	I

We	I
should	I
put	I
our	I
own	I
survival	I

sustainment	I
in	I

first	I
before	I
considering	I
the	I
conservation	I
of	I

In	I
conclusion	I
,	O
more	I
emphasis	I
should	I
be	I
laid	I
on	I
human	I

it	I
is	I

The	I
opportunity	I
to	I
receive	I
education	I
from	I
university	I
There	I
are	I
many	I
factors	I
that	I
contribute	I
to	I
one	I
's	I
success	I
.	I
However	I
,	O
which	I
factor	I
is	I
the	I
most	I
influential	I
one	I
is	I
open	I
to	I
debate	I
.	I
Some	I
people	I
believe	I
that	I
nowadays	I
the	I
assitance	I
from	I
family	I
is	I
quite	I
a	I
essential	I
factor	I
in	I
one	I
's	I
success	I
.	I
It	I
seems	I
that	I
one	I
can	I
achieve	I
success	I
more	I
easily	I
with	I
the	I
help	I
from	I
his	I
or	I
her	I
family	I
.	I
I	I
agree	I
with	I
this	I
statement	I
.	I
In	I
my	I
opinion	I
,	O
family	I
plays	I
a	I
more	I
important	I
role	I
in	I
helping	I
one	I
to	I
pursuit	I
success	I
.	I
There	I
are	I
a	I
couple	I
of	I
reasons	I
.	I
First	I
of	I
all	I
,	O
more	I
and	I
more	I
people	I
have	I
the	I
opportunity	I
to	I
receive	I
education	I
from	I
university	I
.	I
Since	I
our	I
parents	I
receive	I
better	I
education	I
than	I
our	I
grandparents	I
did	I
,	O
they	I
can	I
provide	I
more	I
advices	I
and	I
helps	I
in	I
our	I
career	I
.	I
In	I
the	I
past	I
,	O
seldom	I
people	I
have	I
the	I
chance	I
to	I
attend	I
a	I
collage	I
.	I
For	I
example	I
,	O
my	I
grandparents	I
did	I
not	I
get	I
a	I
education	I
even	I
in	I
high	I
school	I
,	O
so	I
when	I
my	I
father	I
had	I
difficulty	I
in	I
solving	I
a	I
problem	I
in	I
his	I
childhood	I
,	I
he	I
had	I
to	I
go	I
to	I
his	I
teacher	I
for	I
help	I
.	I
Things	I
have	I
changed	I
a	I
lot	I
.	I
I	I
grow	I
up	I
in	I
a	I
better	I
condition	I
than	I
my	I
father	I
did	I
.	I
Whenever	I
I	I
have	I
problems	I
,	I
I	I
can	I
always	I
ask	I
my	I
parents	I
for	I
help	I
.	I
They	I
can	I
solve	I
the	I
problem	I
quickly	I
because	I
they	I
have	I
learned	I
quite	I
a	I
lot	I
.	I
What	I
is	I
more	I
,	O
family	I
members	I
can	I
help	I
us	I
in	I
many	I
other	I
aspects	I
.	I
For	I
example	I
,	O
when	I
I	I
did	I
not	I
know	I
what	I
major	I
to	I
choose	I
when	I
I	I
attend	I
university	I
,	I
my	I
father	I
told	I
a	I
lot	I
about	I
different	I
majors	I
.	I
He	I
shared	I
his	I
own	I
experience	I
with	I
me	I
,	I
which	I
helped	I
me	I
quite	I
a	I
lot	I
.	I
Parents	I
are	I
quite	I
experienced	I
than	I
their	I
child	I
,	O
they	I
can	I
guide	I
them	I
toward	I
the	I
right	I
direction	I
.	I
Besides	I
,	I
parents	I
can	I
told	I
their	I
children	I
as	I
many	I
as	I
they	I
can	I
.	I
What	I
they	I
want	I
is	I
help	I
their	I
child	I
to	I
make	I
a	I
progress	I
.	I
In	I
a	I
word	I
,	O
our	I
parents	I
and	I
other	I
family	I
members	I
can	I
help	I
us	I
a	I
lot	I
in	I
our	I
life	I

I	I
believe	I
that	I
with	I
the	I

we	I
can	I
achieve	I
success	I
quite	I

Learning	I
facts	I
has	I
more	I
subsequent	I
advantages	I
for	I
students	I
'	I
future	I
lives	I
There	I
are	I
many	I
debates	I
regarding	I
whether	I
understanding	I
ideas	I
and	I
concepts	I
is	I
more	I
essential	I
than	I
learning	I
facts	I
for	I
students	I
or	I
not	I
.	I
Although	O
multitudes	I
of	I
people	I
think	I
that	I
knowledge	I
of	I
ideas	I
and	I
concepts	I
is	I
more	I
vital	I
for	I
students	I
,	I
I	I
am	I
in	I
the	I
conviction	I
that	I
learning	I
facts	I
has	I
more	I
subsequent	I
advantages	I
for	I
students	I
'	I
future	I
lives	I
.	I
In	I
the	I
following	I
,	O
I	I
will	I
state	I
my	I
reasons	I
for	I
this	I
choice	I
.	I
First	I
,	O
when	I
students	I
learn	I
facts	I
more	I
in	I
school	I
,	O
they	I
would	I
be	I
ready	I
for	I
facing	I
problems	I
in	I
their	I
own	I
life	I
after	I
their	I
graduations	I
.	I
As	I
a	I
case	I
in	I
point	I
,	O
more	I
information	I
about	I
facts	I
would	I
make	I
students	I
more	I
familiar	I
with	I
the	I
real	I
life	I
other	I
that	I
only	I
their	I
concepts	I
.	I
As	I
a	I
result	I
,	O
they	I
would	I
prepare	I
to	I
encounter	I
their	I
life	I
out	I
of	I
school	I
to	I
solve	I
their	I
problems	I
better	I
.	I
Second	I
,	I
it	I
would	I
improve	I
students	I
'	I
social	I
behavior	I
.	I
If	I
students	I
only	I
rely	I
on	I
concepts	I
and	I
ideas	I
theorically	I
,	I
they	I
would	I
not	I
realize	I
human	I
's	I
mind	I
very	I
well	I
.	I
They	I
should	I
understand	I
objects	I
more	I
that	I
concepts	I
to	I
obtain	I
the	I
ability	I
of	I
analyzing	I
matters	I
well	I
.	I
Thus	I
,	O
if	I
they	I
deal	I
more	I
with	I
facts	I
,	O
they	I
can	I
realize	I
social	I
situations	I
effectively	I
and	I
so	I
improve	I
their	I
social	I
communication	I
in	I
everyday	I
life	I
.	I
Moreover	I
,	O
these	I
way	I
students	I
are	I
teached	I
to	I
control	I
their	I
fears	I
and	I
concerns	I
in	I
facing	I
facts	I
.	I
As	I
a	I
matter	I
of	I
fact	I
,	O
when	I
a	I
student	I
understands	I
a	I
fact	I
and	I
its	I
consequences	I
,	O
he	I
or	I
she	I
can	I
encounter	I
it	I
more	I
confidently	I
.	I
In	I
my	I
viewpoint	I
,	I
concerns	I
and	I
anxieties	I
are	I
very	I
destructive	I
in	I
everybody	I
's	I
life	I
.	I
It	I
can	I
prevent	I
person	I
to	I
progress	I
and	I
thrive	I
in	I
every	I
position	I
.	I
All	I
in	I
all	I
,	O
I	I
am	I
in	I
the	I
belief	I
that	I
learning	I
facts	I
is	I
more	I
beneficial	I
for	I
students	I
in	I
both	I
social	I
and	I
individual	I
life	I
in	I
the	I
view	I
of	I
above-mentioned	I
reasons	I
.	I
Students	I
would	I
improve	I
their	I
social	I
positions	I
and	I
encounter	I
their	I
problems	I
in	I
positive	I
ways	I
and	I
also	I
intend	I
in	I
the	I
more	I
confidence	I
manner	I
and	I
etc	I
.	I
	O
Do	I
you	I
agree	I
that	I
the	I
traditional	I
skills	I
will	I
die	I
out	I
?	O
With	O
the	I
development	O
of	I
technology	I
,	O
whether	I
or	I
not	I
it	I
is	I
still	I
necessary	I
to	I
protect	I
the	I
traditional	I
skills	I
and	I
lifestyles	I
leads	I
to	I
a	I
drastic	I
controversy	I
which	I
is	I
becoming	I
a	I
public	I
concern	I
,	O
especially	I
considering	I
the	I
significant	I
impact	I
taken	I
by	I
technology	I
.	I
As	I
far	I
as	I
I	I
am	I
concerned	I
,	I
the	I
importance	I
of	I
traditions	I
should	I
be	I
valued	I
and	I
paid	I
attention	I
to	I
.	I
Traditional	I
skills	I
and	I
lifestyles	I
play	I
important	I
role	I
in	I
modern	I
society	I
,	I
in	I
terms	I
of	I
healthcare	I
,	I
environmental	I
protection	I
and	I
cultural	I
inherit	I
.	I
Although	I
technology	I
takes	I
convenience	I
to	I
humankind	I
,	I
it	I
also	I
contributes	I
to	I
unhealthy	I
behaviors	I
of	I
life	I
,	O
like	I
sedentary	I
lifestyle	I
.	I
Instead	I
,	O
traditional	I
ways	I
of	I
life	I
is	I
a	I
great	I
complimentary	I
for	I
modern	I
life	I
and	I
highlight	I
the	I
importance	I
of	I
work	I
life	I
balance	I
.	I
Meanwhile	O
,	O
due	I
to	I
the	I
fact	I
that	I
traditional	I
skills	I
rely	I
little	I
on	I
fossil	I
energy	I
,	O
it	I
is	I
more	I
environmentally-friendly	I
,	I
which	I
should	I
be	I
promoted	I
to	I
reduce	I
the	I
threat	I
of	I
climate	I
change	I
.	I
Furthermore	I
those	I
tradition-related	I
things	I
convey	I
traditional	I
culture	I
and	I
values	I
.	I
These	I
are	I
important	I
foundation	I
of	I
modern	I
civilization	I
.	I
Protection	I
of	I
tradition	I
can	I
provide	I
the	I
possibility	I
to	I
better	I
understand	I
ancient	I
culture	I
and	I
utilize	I
them	I
to	I
tackle	I
modern	I
problems	I
.	I
Some	I
people	I
who	I
hold	I
different	I
viewpoints	I
may	I
advocate	I
that	I
protecting	I
traditions	I
consume	I
too	I
much	I
financial	I
budget	I
compared	I
with	I
the	I
incoming	I
it	I
takes	I
.	I
In	I
spite	I
of	I
the	I
fact	I
this	I
kind	I
of	I
business	I
bring	I
limited	I
contribution	I
to	I
government	I
finance	I
,	I
it	I
should	I
be	I
emphasized	I
that	I
the	I
expense	I
is	I
trivial	I
compared	I
with	I
the	I
potential	I
value	I
of	I
traditions	I
.	I
Therefore	O
the	I
government	I
authorities	I
and	I
education	I
institutes	I
should	I
work	I
closely	I
together	I
to	I
promote	I
the	I
traditional	I
skills	I
and	I
ways	I
of	I
life	I
,	O
so	I
as	I
to	I
make	I
people	I
to	I
realize	I
the	I
value	I
of	I
them	I
.	I
All	I
in	I
all	I
,	O
protection	I
of	I
tradition	I
is	I
not	I
only	I
important	I
for	I
the	I
entire	I
society	I
currently	I
,	I
but	I
also	I
contributes	I
to	I
the	I
next	I
generation	I
.	I
Follow	I
the	I
New	I
Customs	I
of	I
the	I
New	I
Country	I
or	I
Not	I
?	O
When	I
people	I
move	I
to	I
another	I
country	I
,	O
most	I
likely	I
,	O
they	I
will	I
face	I
the	I
choice	I
between	I
following	I
the	I
customs	I
of	I
the	I
new	I
country	I
or	I
keeping	I
their	I
original	I
one	I
.	I
Some	I
people	I
choose	I
the	I
former	I
one	I
to	I
assimilate	I
themselves	I
into	I
the	I
new	I
culture	I
,	I
while	I
some	I
insist	I
the	I
latter	I
one	I
because	I
the	I
new	I
customs	I
are	I
difficult	I
to	I
be	I
accepted	I
.	I
As	I
for	I
me	I
,	O
I	I
would	I
follow	I
the	I
new	I
customs	I
,	O
if	I
I	I
migrated	I
to	I
another	I
country	I
.	I
On	I
one	I
hand	I
,	O
it	I
will	I
be	I
easier	I
for	I
people	I
to	I
assimilate	I
into	I
a	I
new	I
country	I
,	O
if	I
they	I
follow	I
the	I
new	I
customs	I
.	I
When	I
people	I
migrate	I
to	I
a	I
new	I
country	I
,	O
they	I
are	I
likely	I
to	I
suffer	I
the	I
culture	I
shock	I
,	I
because	I
of	I
the	I
difference	I
between	I
two	I
cultures	I
.	I
The	I
custom	I
is	I
just	I
a	I
form	I
of	I
the	I
culture	I
and	I
following	I
the	I
custom	I
is	I
a	I
good	I
way	I
to	I
know	I
more	I
about	I
this	I
culture	I
.	I
For	I
example	I
,	O
if	I
one	I
wore	I
in	I
white	I
and	I
went	I
to	I
common	I
Viharas	I
to	I
observe	I
a	I
rather	I
longer-than-usual	I
,	O
full-length	I
Buddhist	I
sutra	I
in	I
Buddha	I
's	I
Birthday	I
in	I
India	I
,	O
he	I
or	I
she	I
would	I
learn	I
something	I
about	I
Indian	I
religion	I
and	I
culture	I
.	I
As	I
a	I
result	I
,	O
people	I
understand	I
the	I
culture	I
,	I
and	I
then	I
they	I
adapt	I
to	I
the	I
new	I
country	I
.	I
On	I
the	I
other	I
hand	I
,	I
keeping	I
own	I
customs	I
stably	I
might	I
cause	I
discrimination	I
.	I
When	I
people	I
insist	I
to	I
keep	I
their	I
own	I
customs	I
and	I
refuse	I
to	I
accept	I
the	I
new	I
one	I
,	I
they	I
regard	I
themselves	I
as	I
a	I
special	I
group	I
in	I
the	I
new	I
country	I
.	I
The	I
local	I
people	I
may	I
also	I
regard	I
them	I
as	I
a	I
special	I
group	I
as	I
well	I
and	I
separate	I
them	I
from	I
the	I
main-stream	I
society	I
.	I
One	I
example	I
of	I
this	I
is	I
that	I
the	I
Chinese	I
immigrants	I
in	I
Indonesia	I
in	I
1969	I
.	I
They	I
formed	I
Chinatown	I
and	I
kept	I
Chinese	I
language	I
and	I
customs	I
in	I
it	I
.	I
While	I
the	I
Indonesians	I
stopped	I
working	I
at	I
4:00	I
pm	I
and	I
went	I
home	I
for	I
rest	I
,	I
Chinese	I
immigrants	I
were	I
still	I
working	I
.	I
Although	I
being	I
much	I
richer	I
than	I
local	I
people	I
,	I
they	I
faced	I
the	I
discrimination	I
.	I
Their	I
houses	I
and	I
private	I
cars	I
were	I
buried	I
by	I
local	I
people	I
,	I
because	I
the	I
locals	I
were	I
jealous	I
of	I
Chinese	I
people	I
,	I
who	I
had	I
so	I
much	I
wealth	I
,	I
which	I
should	I
have	I
been	I
theirs	I
.	I
If	O
the	I
Chinese	I
immigrants	I
had	I
followed	I
the	I
local	I
customs	I
and	I
assimilated	I
into	I
Indonesia	I
,	I
they	I
would	I
not	I
have	I
been	I
regards	I
as	I
a	I
group	I
of	I
Chinese	I
and	I
discrimination	I
might	I
have	I
been	I
alleviated	I
.	I
All	I
in	I
all	I
,	O
the	I
immigrants	I
should	I
follow	I
the	I
customs	I
in	I
the	I
new	I
country	I
,	O
which	I
can	I
help	I
them	I
survive	I
from	I
the	I
culture	I

sooner	I

Some	I

study	I
alone	I
Everyone	I

their	I
method	I
to	I
success	I
in	I
life	I

At	I
school	I
or	I
university	I
,	I
success	I
depends	I
on	I
how	I
we	I
study	I
.	I
Some	I
students	I
benefit	I
a	I
lot	I
when	I
they	I
study	I
with	I
groups	I
.	I
Yet	I
,	O
I	I
prefer	I
to	I
study	I
individually	I
because	I
it	I
helps	I
me	I
to	I
concentrate	I
more	I
,	I
and	I
it	I
helps	I
me	I
to	I
build	I
my	I
personality	I
.	I
Studying	I
alone	I
helps	I
us	I
to	I
focus	I
more	I
in	I
our	I
lessons	I

For	I
instance	I
,	O
I	I
am	I
a	I
type	I
of	I
person	I
who	I
can	I
not	I
comprehend	I
my	I
subjects	I
unless	I
I	I
am	I
alone	I
.	I
I	I
can	I
prepare	I
my	I
schedules	I
,	O
guidelines	I
,	O
exercises	I
and	I
go	I
over	I
them	I
all	I
.	I
Moreover	I
,	O
we	I
have	I
a	I
lot	I
of	I
subjects	I
which	I
require	I
us	I
to	I
sit	I
and	I
study	I
alone	I
such	I
as	I
math	I
,	O
reading	I
,	O
and	I
drawing	I

In	I
my	I
opinion	I

I	I
can	I
take	I
advantage	I

every	I
minute	I
without	I
wasting	I
by	I
studying	I
alone	I

Additionally	I
,	O
we	I
are	I
building	I
our	I
personalities	I
when	I
we	I
study	I
alone	I
.	I
For	I
example	I
,	O
answering	I
our	I
homework	I
alone	I
encourages	I
us	I
to	I
be	I
more	I
responsible	I

independent	I

Also	I
,	O
it	I

us	I

Personally	I
,	O
when	I
I	I
fix	I
my	I
study	I
plan	I
with	I
a	I
specific	I
time	I

finish	I
it	I
on	I
time	I

it	I
improves	I
my	I
ability	I
in	I
the	I
future	I
to	I
become	I
more	I
precise	I

careful	I
.	I
To	I
conclude	I
,	O
there	I
are	I
many	I
ways	I
to	I
study	I
and	I
it	I
is	I
our	I
right	I
to	I
choose	I
which	I
is	I
suitable	I
for	I
our	I
characters	I
whether	I
alone	I
or	I
with	I
group	I

In	I
fact	I
,	O
I	I
agree	I
with	I
the	I
idea	I
of	I
studying	I
a	I
lone	I
since	I
it	I
helps	I
me	I
to	I
focus	I

my	I

Success	I
needs	I
us	I

When	I

I	I
would	I

irreplaceable	I

There	I

no	I

that	I
our	I

In	I

a	I
good	I

for	I

Once	I
the	I

Thanks	I
to	I
the	I
considerate	I

,	O
the	I
diversity	I
of	I

to	I

When	I

about	I
the	I

It	I
is	I
true	I
that	I
some	I

are	I
lack	I
of	I
systematic	I
management	I
which	I
attributes	I
to	I
numerous	I
wild	I
animals	I

because	I

Also	I
,	O

the	I

survive	I
in	I
nature	I
where	I
is	I
full	I
of	I
cruel	I
competition	I
among	I
various	I
animals	I
.	I
In	I
order	I
to	I
protect	I
animals	I
,	O
from	I
my	I
perspective	I
,	O
zoos	I
offer	I
a	I
good	I
man-made	I
environment	I
which	I
could	I
prolong	I
the	I
life	I
span	I
of	I
wild	I
animals	I
and	I
cultivate	I
the	I
notion	I
of	I
protecting	I
animals	I
.	I
What	I
the	I
zoos	I
should	I
do	I
is	I
improvement	I
of	I
the	I
management	I

use	I
the	I

	O
Paying	I
taxes	I
is	I
enough	I
contribution	I
from	I

Paying	I
taxes	I
is	I
the	I
obligation	I
of	I
citizens	I
in	I
almost	I
every	I
country	I
.	I
Some	I
people	I
believe	I
that	I
they	I
have	I
made	I
enough	I
contribution	I
to	I
the	I
country	I
by	I
doing	I
that	I
.	I
Personally	I
,	O
I	I
tend	I
to	I
disagree	I
with	I
this	I
view	I
.	I
To	I
start	I
with	I
,	O
all	I
people	I
who	I
are	I
able	I
to	I
work	I
should	I
pay	I
tax	I
to	I
the	I
government	I
,	O
as	I
it	I
is	I
the	I
most	I
important	I
source	I
of	I
government	I
's	I
revenue	I
,	O
which	I
is	I
mainly	I
used	I
to	I
serve	I
all	I
citizens	I
.	I
For	I
example	I
,	O
a	I
large	I
proportion	I
of	I
the	I
tax	I
is	I
spent	I
on	I
national	I
defence	I
and	I
in	I
maintaining	I
social	I
stability	I
,	I
so	I
that	I
every	I
one	I
can	I
work	I
and	I
live	I
in	I
a	I
peaceful	I
environment	I
.	I
The	I
tax	I
is	I
also	I
used	I
to	I
pay	I
the	I
salaries	I
of	I
workers	I
working	I
in	I
public	I
service	I
sectors	I
,	I
such	I
as	I
teachers	I
and	I
police	I
officers	I
.	I
Although	I
these	I
workers	I
do	I
not	I
produce	I
profit	I
directly	I
,	O
what	I
they	I
do	I
is	I
for	I
the	I
well-being	I
of	I
the	I
whole	I
society	I
.	I
However	I
,	O
I	I
would	I
argue	I
that	I
citizens	I
have	I
other	I
important	I
responsibilities	I
to	I
fulfil	I
apart	I
from	I
paying	I
tax	I
.	I
As	I
we	I
know	I
,	O
there	I
are	I
impoverished	I
or	I
disabled	I
people	I
in	I
every	I
society	I
,	I
needing	I
help	I
and	I
support	I
from	I
others	I
.	I
It	I
is	I
true	I
that	I
the	I
government	I
can	I
provide	I
some	I
fund	I
to	I
ease	I
their	I
difficulties	I
,	O
but	I
such	I
financial	I
help	I
is	I
usually	I
far	I
from	I
enough	I
.	I
In	I
such	I
case	I
,	O
aids	I
from	I
more	I
capable	I
or	I
wealthier	I
citizens	I
are	I
particularly	I
crucial	I
,	I
which	I
are	I
a	I
great	I
complement	I
to	I
government	I
support	I
.	I
Another	I
responsibility	I
all	I
citizens	I
should	I
take	I
is	I
to	I
maintain	I
social	I
stability	I
together	I
with	I
the	I
police	I
force	I
.	I
There	I
are	I
criminals	I
in	I
every	I
society	I
,	I
and	I
the	I
number	I
of	I
policemen	I
the	I
government	I
can	I
hire	I
is	I
limited	I
.	I
So	O
it	I
is	I
quite	I
necessary	I
for	I
the	I
local	I
residents	I
to	I
take	I
actions	I
and	I
ensure	I
the	I
safety	I
of	I
the	I
communities	I
,	O
by	I
doing	I
things	I
like	I
reporting	I
suspicious	I
activities	I
to	I
the	I
police	I
department	I
.	I
In	I
conclusion	I
,	O
it	I
is	I
a	I
significant	I
obligation	I
of	I
citizens	I
to	I
pay	I
tax	I
to	I
the	I
government	I
.	I
Other	I
than	I
that	I
,	O
they	I
have	I
other	I
critical	I
obligations	I
to	I
take	I

in	I
order	I
to	I
make	I
our	I
society	I

Learning	I
to	I
be	I
independent	I
is	I
essential	I
for	I
young	I
adults	I
.	I
However	I
,	O
how	I
early	I
the	I
children	I
leave	I
their	I
parents	I
is	I
a	I
difficult	I
issue	I
.	I
In	I
my	I
point	I
of	I
view	I
,	O
staying	I
with	I
the	I
parents	I
for	I
longer	I
time	I
does	I
more	I
benefits	I
than	I
disadvantages	I
to	I
the	I
young	I
adult	I
.	I
My	I
opinion	I
is	I
based	I
on	I
creating	I
memories	I
with	I
parents	I
,	O
saving	I
money	I
,	O
and	I
taking	I
advice	I
from	I
parents	I
.	I
First	I
of	I
all	I
,	O
one	I
of	I
the	I
most	I
significant	I
upsides	I
is	I
that	I
the	I
young	I
adult	I
can	I
have	I
more	I
experience	I
with	I
his	I
parents	I
.	I
The	I
young	I
adult	I
has	I
to	I
try	I
to	I
create	I
memories	I
with	I
his	I
dad	I
and	I
mom	I
in	I
the	I
early	I
age	I
.	I
When	I
having	I
a	I
job	I
,	I
it	I
is	I
of	I
low	I
possibilities	I
to	I
work	I
in	I
his	I
hometown	I
.	I
If	I
he	I
lives	I
with	I
his	I
parents	I
for	I
longer	I
time	I
,	I
they	I
have	I
more	I
chances	I
to	I
share	I
the	I
feelings	I
,	I
exercise	I
,	I
and	I
travel	I
together	I
.	I
All	I
memories	I
become	I
priceless	I
treasure	I
as	I
time	I
passes	I
by	I
.	I
Thus	I
,	I
I	I
think	I
undergoing	I
with	I
parents	I
is	I
worthwhile	I
.	I
Furthermore	I
,	I
living	I
at	I
home	I
costs	I
less	I
than	I
living	I
outside	I
.	I
Learning	I
to	I
be	I
independent	I
means	I
that	I
the	I
young	I
adult	I
needs	I
to	I
leave	I
home	I
.	I
Therefore	I
,	O
he	I
may	I
have	I
to	I
rent	I
a	I
house	I
and	I
the	I
rental	I
would	I
become	I
a	I
burden	I
for	I
parents	I
.	I
Moreover	I
,	I
another	I
daily	I
expense	I
is	I
also	I
the	I
considerable	I
outgoings	I
.	I
Spending	I
much	I
money	I
may	I
not	I
result	I
in	I
what	I
the	I
parents	I
expect	I
their	I
children	I
to	I
be	I
.	I
In	I
a	I
word	I
,	O
the	I
parents	I
can	I
save	I
money	I
,	I
if	I
their	I
children	I
live	I
with	I
them	I
longer	I
.	I
The	I
third	I
convincing	I
reason	I
is	I
that	I
the	I
young	I
adult	I
needs	I
father	I
and	I
mother	I
's	I
suggestions	I
.	I
When	I
in	I
dilemma	I
,	I
the	I
parents	I
can	I
comfort	I
him	I
and	I
give	I
him	I
a	I
big	I
hand	I
.	I
They	I
are	I
the	I
people	I
who	I
are	I
most	I
familiar	I
with	I
him	I
can	I
give	I
a	I
suitable	I
advice	I
and	I
lead	I
him	I
to	I
the	I
right	I
way	I
.	I
If	I
the	I
parents	I
do	I
not	I
help	I
him	I
immediately	I
,	O
he	I
would	I
have	I
to	I
suffer	I
more	I
pain	I
.	I
Hence	I
,	O
taking	I
advice	I
from	I
parents	I
,	O
the	I
young	I
adult	I
can	I
go	I
through	I
obstacles	I
easily	I
.	I
To	I
sum	I
up	I
,	O
living	I
with	I
parents	I
longer	I
brings	I
about	I
memories	I
with	I
parents	I
,	O
less	I
cost	I
,	O
and	I
advice	I
from	I
parents	I
.	I
Hence	I
,	O
staying	I
longer	I
with	I
parents	I
is	I
a	I
better	I
choice	I
.	I
Advertising	I
-	O
positive	I
or	I
negative	I
part	I
of	I
our	I
lives	I
Nowadays	I
,	O
the	I
use	I
of	I
advertisement	I
through	I
different	I
forms	I
of	I
media	I
such	I
as	I
newspapers	I
,	O
radio	I
and	I
television	I
has	I
become	I
very	I
prevalent	I
,	O
so	I
it	I
is	I
thought	I
to	I
be	I
a	I
necessary	I
part	I
of	I
today	I
's	I
society	I
.	I
Many	I
believe	I
that	I
advertising	I
has	I
brought	I
great	I
benefits	I
to	I
lives	I
therefore	I
it	I
should	I
be	I
considered	I
a	I
positive	I
activity	I
while	I
others	I
have	I
held	I
a	I
complete	I
different	I
idea	I
about	I
this	I
.	I
Both	I
views	I
will	I
be	I
critiqued	I
before	I
a	I
reasonable	I
conclusion	I
is	I
drawn	I
.	I
First	I
,	O
it	I
is	I
generally	I
understood	I
that	I
advertising	I
is	I
carried	I
out	I
with	I
the	I
main	I
purpose	I
of	I
promoting	I
different	I
products	I
and	I
services	I
or	I
encouraging	I
people	I
to	I
consume	I
more	I
.	I
Advertisements	I
are	I
,	O
therefore	I
,	O
very	I
important	I
for	I
many	I
businesses	I
to	I
increase	I
sales	I
and	I
hence	I
profits	I
.	I
Also	I
,	O
to	I
consumers	I
,	O
advertising	I
can	I
bring	I
them	I
many	I
benefits	I
.	I
For	I
example	I
,	O
customers	I
of	I
telecommunication	I
services	I
will	I
have	I
an	I
idea	I
about	I
the	I
current	I
offers	I
of	I
different	I
companies	I
and	I
hence	I
they	I
can	I
compare	I
them	I
and	I
then	I
have	I
a	I
better	I
decision	I
in	I
choosing	I
their	I
internet	I
or	I
mobile	I
phone	I
plans	I
.	I
From	I
all	I
of	I
these	I
,	O
it	I
is	I
easy	I
to	I
see	I
why	I
the	I
idea	I
that	I
advertising	I
is	I
a	I
positive	I
part	I
of	I
life	I
will	I
garner	I
strong	I
support	I
.	I
However	I
,	O
it	I
can	I
be	I
seen	I
that	I
some	I
people	I
have	I
argued	I
against	I
advertising	I
due	I
to	I
its	I
negative	I
impacts	I
.	I
Firstly	O
,	O
a	I
huge	I
amount	I
of	I
different	I
advertisements	I
could	I
be	I
sent	I
automatically	I
by	I
a	I
system	I
to	I
personal	I
phones	I
or	I
email	I
addresses	I
,	O
this	I
is	I
generally	I
known	I
as	I
spam	I
,	O
and	I
causes	I
discomfort	I
or	I
even	I
annoyance	I
to	I
many	I
people	I
.	I
Secondly	I
,	O
advertising	I
can	I
be	I
very	I
expensive	I
and	I
not	I
every	I
advertising	I
campaign	I
can	I
be	I
done	I
successfully	I
and	I
brings	I
good	I
results	I
.	I
Therefore	I
,	O
advertising	I
is	I
believed	I
by	I
many	I
,	O
a	I
financial	I
burden	I
to	I
businesses	I
.	I
In	I
conclusion	I
,	O
after	I
analyzing	I
the	I
pros	I
and	I
cons	I
of	I
advertising	I
,	O
both	I
of	I
the	I
views	I
have	I
strong	I
support	I
,	O
but	I
it	I
is	I
felt	I
that	I
more	I
good	I
comes	I
from	I
advertising	I
than	I
bad	I
.	I
Thus	I
,	O
the	I
idea	I
that	I
advertising	I
is	I
a	I
positive	I
part	I
of	I
life	I
can	I
be	I
more	I
supported	I
.	I
	O
We	I
can	I
not	I
forcedly	I
put	I
the	I
same	I
numbers	I
of	I
males	I
and	I
females	I
into	I
every	I
subject	I
There	I
is	I
a	I
view	I
that	I
universities	I
and	I
colleges	I
should	I
equally	I
enroll	I
male	I
and	I
female	I
students	I
in	I
numbers	I
in	I
each	I
faculty	I
.	I
Personally	I
,	O
I	I
do	I
not	I
agree	I
the	I
viewpoint	I
,	O
because	I
many	I
different	I
characters	I
exist	I
between	I
male	I
and	I
female	I
students	I
.	I
On	I
one	I
hand	I
,	I
boys	I
and	I
girls	I
have	I
the	I
diversity	I
in	I
psychological	I
modes	I
and	I
individuality	I
.	I
Most	I
of	I
male	I
students	I
tend	I
to	I
use	I
their	I
left	I
brain	I
to	I
think	I
and	I
act	I
,	O
and	I
they	I
are	I
more	I
rational	I
and	I
logical	I
than	I
girls	I
in	I
many	I
cases	I
.	I
For	I
instance	I
,	O
there	I
are	I
more	I
male	I
scientists	I
and	I
engineers	I
in	I
comparison	I
with	I
females	I
around	I
the	I
world	I
.	I
Many	I
boys	I
are	I
interested	I
in	I
science	I
and	I
technology	I
,	O
while	I
a	I
number	I
of	I
girls	I
like	I
to	I
learn	I
literature	I
,	O
education	I
and	I
arts	I
.	I
Besides	I
,	O
girls	I
are	I
more	I
likely	I
to	I
prefer	I
some	I
jobs	I
related	I
to	I
emotion	I
and	I
communication	I
,	I
such	I
as	I
teacher	I
,	I
singer	I
and	I
interpreter	I
.	I
This	I
means	I
that	I
girls	I
differ	I
from	I
boys	I
in	I
mind	I
and	I
behaviour	I
to	I
a	I
large	I
extent	I
,	O
and	I
they	I
both	I
have	I
better	I
ability	I
in	I
the	I
specific	I
aspect	I
.	I
Furthermore	O
,	O
it	I
can	I
have	I
a	I
negative	I
affect	I
on	I
these	I
students	I
to	I
require	I
them	I
to	I
choose	I
a	I
subject	I
in	I
equal	I
proportion	I
of	I
gender	I
,	O
and	I
that	I
does	I
not	I
conform	I
to	I
students	I
'	I
personality	I
traits	I
and	I
mental	I
development	I
.	I
For	I
example	I
,	O
a	I
girl	I
,	O
who	I
is	I
interested	I
in	I
literature	I
,	O
is	I
arranged	I
into	I
an	I
engineering	I
department	I
,	O
but	I
she	I
is	I
unlikely	I
to	I
focus	I
on	I
her	I
subject	I
,	O
and	I
this	I
also	I
can	I
block	I
the	I
girl	I
's	I
future	I
development	I
and	I
career	I
prospect	I
.	I
On	O
the	I
other	I
hand	I
,	O
universities	I
should	I
encourage	I
more	I
girls	I
to	I
choose	I
science	I
subjects	I
and	I
more	I
boys	I
to	I
study	I
the	I
humanities	I
,	I
and	I
this	I
could	I
avoid	I
imbalance	I
of	I
gender	I
in	I
some	I
subjects	I
.	I
It	I
would	I
affect	I
students	I
'	I
mental	I
health	I
to	I
study	I
in	I
the	I
environment	I
of	I
single	I
gender	I
.	I
In	I
conclusion	I
,	O
it	I
is	I
necessary	I
for	I
universities	I
to	I
respect	I
the	I
individual	I
choice	I
of	I
subject	I
due	I
to	I
the	I

These	I

Secondly	I

there	I

Scientists	I

All	I
this	I

try	I
to	I
take	I
control	I

the	I
Earth	I

In	I
conclusion	I
,	O
I	I
agree	I
that	I
IT	I
discoveries	I
are	I
likely	I
to	I
have	I
more	I
disadvantages	I
than	I
benefits	I
and	I
people	I
should	I
know	I
how	I
to	I
use	I
their	I
developments	I
properly	I
.	I
A	I
single	I
international	I
language	I
or	I
not	I
?	O
The	I
21st	I
century	I
has	I
witnessed	I
the	I
sweeping	I
trends	I
of	I
globalization	I
,	I
which	I
raises	I
people	I
's	I
concerns	I
about	I
whether	I
a	I
single	I
international	I
language	I
should	I
be	I
a	I
necessity	I
or	I
not	I
.	I
From	I
my	I
perspective	I
,	O
a	I
universal	I
language	I
playing	I
the	I
dominant	I
role	I
in	I
the	I
international	I
community	I
is	I
of	I
vital	I
significance	I
to	I
global	I
people	I
.	I
It	I
is	I
especially	I
true	I
if	I
we	I
consider	I
the	I
fact	I
that	I
a	I
single	I
international	I
language	I
plays	I
a	I
pivotal	I
role	I
in	I
global	I
economic	I
cooperation	I
.	I
As	O
businessmen	I
from	I
different	I
countries	I
have	I
access	I
to	I
the	I
same	I
language	I
,	O
they	I
can	I
communicate	I
with	I
each	I
other	I
more	I
efficiently	I
and	I
deeply	I
on	I
trade	I
,	O
which	I
can	I
intensify	I
the	I
transnational	I
cooperation	I
.	I
In	I
contrast	I
,	O
without	I
the	I
availability	I
of	I
the	I
same	I
language	I
,	O
there	I
might	I
be	I
a	I
chance	I
that	I
misunderstanding	I
and	I
conflicts	I
would	I
ensue	I
over	I
business	I
negotiations	I
,	O
impeding	I
collaborations	I
between	I
them	I
.	I
Therefore	I
,	O
a	I
single	I
international	I
language	I
serves	I
an	I
economic	I
purpose	I
.	I
Also	I
,	O
a	I
universal	I
language	I
is	I
an	I
integral	I
part	I
of	I
cultural	I
communication	I
and	I
interactions	I
.	I
If	O
people	O
are	I
equipped	I
with	I
a	I
single	I
international	I
language	I
,	O
they	I
can	I
tell	I
each	I
other	I
smoothly	I
about	I
their	I
countries	I
'	I
specific	I
cultures	I
such	I
as	I
the	I
traditional	I
customs	I
or	I
the	I
modern	I
lifestyles	I
,	O
which	I
enables	I
people	I
to	I
expand	I
their	I
outlooks	I
,	O
viewing	I
the	I
world	I
in	I
new	I
angles	I
.	I
For	I
example	I
,	O
when	I
people	I
travel	I
to	I
foreign	I
countries	I
,	O
the	I
local	I
people	I
can	I
introduce	I
the	I
tourist	I
attractions	I
to	I
such	I
people	I
with	I
the	I
command	I
of	I
the	I
universal	I
language	I
,	O
helping	I
foreign	I
visitors	I
have	I
an	I
enjoyable	I
exotic	I
experience	I
.	I
In	I
spite	I
of	I
this	I
,	O
the	I
disadvantages	I
of	I
the	I
promotion	I
of	I
a	I
universal	I
language	I
can	I
not	I
be	I
denied	I
.	I
To	I
be	I
more	I
specific	I
,	O
a	I
single	I
international	I
language	I
may	I
,	I
to	I
some	I
extent	I
,	I
erode	I
the	I
cultural	I
identity	I
of	I
a	I
nation	I
.	I
This	I
is	I
because	I
people	I
may	I
be	I
impressed	I
by	I
the	I
cultural	I
values	I
brought	I
with	I
the	I
universal	I
language	I
,	O
eroding	I
a	I
sense	I
of	I
national	I
belong	I
.	I
For	I
instance	O
,	O
some	I
Asians	I
are	I
seeking	I
individualism	I
,	O
previously	I
denied	I
by	I
many	I
Asian	I
countries	I
,	O
due	I
to	I
the	I
fact	I
that	I
they	I
have	I
gradually	I
identified	I
with	I
such	I
values	I
expressed	I
in	I
American	I
movies	I
,	O
which	I
are	I
imported	I
by	I
the	I
governments	I
as	I
a	I
result	I
of	I
the	I
proliferation	I
of	I
English	I
.	I
Therefore	I
,	O
I	I
would	I
conclude	I
that	I
a	I
single	I
international	I
language	I
contributes	I
to	I
global	I
community	I
in	I
terms	I
of	I
economic	I
and	I
cultural	I
communication	I
.	I
On	I
the	I
other	I
hand	I
,	O
every	I
country	I
should	I
by	I
no	I
means	I
disregard	I
the	I
preservation	I
of	I
their	I
own	I
cultural	I
heritage	I
.	I
	O
Foreign	I
language	I
instruction	I
should	I
begin	I
in	I
kindergarten	I
Educational	I
institutions	I
have	I
different	I
systems	I
when	I
it	I
comes	I
to	I
introducing	I
foreign	I
languages	I
to	I
children	I
.	I
Some	I
people	I
believe	I
that	I
foreign	I
language	I
instruction	I
should	I
start	I
in	I
pre-school	I
.	I
However	I
,	I
those	I
who	I
disagree	I
contend	I
that	I
this	I
should	I
be	I
taught	I
in	I
later	I
years	I
.	I
This	I
issue	I
has	I
garnered	I
some	I
attention	I
in	I
the	I
academe	I
as	I
it	I
has	I
an	I
impact	I
on	I
the	I
children	I
's	I
learning	I
.	I
I	I
personally	I
believe	I
that	I
it	I
is	I
important	I
for	I
children	I
to	I
be	I
taught	I
with	I
a	I
secondary	I
language	I
as	I
early	I
as	I
kindergarten	I
.	I
To	I
begin	I
with	I
,	O
children	I
might	I
not	I
be	I
really	I
comfortable	I
with	I
the	I
use	I
of	I
a	I
language	I
other	I
than	I
their	I
native	I
tongue	I
when	I
they	I
are	I
in	I
their	I
kindergarten	I
years	I
.	I
Learning	I
at	I
school	I
must	I
be	I
convenient	I
for	I
them	I
if	I
they	I
speak	I
in	I
a	I
way	I
that	I
they	I
are	I
used	I
to	I
.	I
Moreover	I
,	O
teachers	I
think	I
that	I
foreign	I
language	I
most	I
likely	I
leads	I
to	I
confusion	I
for	I
children	I
who	I
are	I
yet	I
to	I
start	I
learning	I
.	I
Another	I
important	I
thing	I
to	I
consider	I
is	I
that	I
the	I
teacher	I
should	I
be	I
well-trained	I
in	I
the	I
use	I
of	I
this	I
specific	I
language	I
,	O
so	I
quality	I
education	I
will	I
be	I
delivered	I
.	I
Nevertheless	I
,	O
it	I
is	I
undeniable	I
that	I
kids	I
are	I
amazing	I
learners	I
,	I
and	I
the	I
best	I
time	I
to	I
hone	I
them	I
is	I
in	I
their	I
younger	I
years	I
.	I
The	I
introduction	I
of	I
foreign	I
language	I
will	I
be	I
new	I
to	I
them	I
;	I
however	I
,	I
their	I
curiosity	I
will	I
drive	I
them	I
to	I
learn	I
and	I
comprehend	I
.	I
In	I
this	I
way	I
,	O
grasping	I
a	I
new	I
language	I
will	I
be	I
natural	I
to	I
them	I
.	I
In	I
addition	I
,	I
the	I
positive	I
impact	I
of	I
this	I
strategy	I
is	I
beneficial	I
to	I
both	I
learners	I
and	I
teachers	I
.	I
Teachers	I
will	I
not	I
find	I
it	I
difficult	I
to	I
make	I
students	I
learn	I
such	I
new	I
concept	I
in	I
their	I
teenage	I
years	I
.	I
It	I
is	I
certainly	I
clear	I
that	I
the	I
advantages	I
of	I
early	I
introduction	I
of	I
foreign	I
language	I
outweigh	I
its	I
disadvantages	I
.	I
In	I
conclusion	I
,	O
the	I
use	I
of	I
foreign	I
language	I
instruction	I
as	I
early	I
as	I
kindergarten	I
is	I
supported	I
by	I
some	I
people	I
;	I
however	I
,	I
there	I
are	I
those	I
who	I
disagree	I
.	I
I	I
am	O
totally	I
convinced	I
that	I
if	I
this	I
endeavour	I
is	I
properly	I
implemented	I
by	I
schools	I
,	O
this	I
will	I
most	I
likely	I
lead	I
to	I
improvement	I
